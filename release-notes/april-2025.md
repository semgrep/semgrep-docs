## ‚õìÔ∏è Semgrep Supply Chain

### Added

- [SBOM exports through the Semgrep API](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/#tag/SupplyChainService/operation/semgrep_app.products.sca.handlers.sbom.openapi_create_sbom_export) is now generally available.
- Malicious dependency detection is now in **public beta**. Semgrep can detect malicious dependencies in your projects and in pull requests (PRs) or merge requests (MRs), allowing you to investigate its impact, identify indicators of compromise or security breach, and mitigate the threats.
- **Upgrade guidance** and **click to fix** are now in **private beta** for users with Python projects hosted by GitHub.com and Semgrep Assistant enabled. With upgrade guidance and click to fix, Supply Chain analyzes your project to surface breaking changes that you must fix as part of a version upgrade. Semgrep AppSec Platform provides you with a one-click option that opens a pull request to:
    1. Bump the version.
    2. Lets the developer know if the upgrade is safe or if there are breaking changes and what those changes are.
- **Transitive reachability** is now in **private beta**. For JavaScript projects, Semgrep reachability now extends to transitive dependencies.

- Increased the rate limit for SBOM exports through the Semgrep API.

### Added

- Semgrep Assistant now attempts to create a memory during triage if possible.
- Assistant Memories v2 is now in **private beta**:
  - Managing memories in Semgrep AppSec Platform now occurs under **Policies**, not **Settings**.
  - Semgrep AppSec Platform displays data on the scope and impact of memories, including the number of findings affected and which findings affected
  - Assistant now provides **suggested memories**, which are those that Assistant has generated based on your past triage actions. For each suggestion, you can choose one of the following actions:
