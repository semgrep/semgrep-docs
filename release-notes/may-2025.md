# Semgrep release notes for May 2025

<!-- Remember to update latest endpoint -->
<!-- Remember to update index page -->


## üåê Semgrep AppSec Platform
<!-- katie -->

- Fixed CI output so it shows per-product links depending on what product is enabled in a scan.
- CLI: Fixed --help documentation to reflect that, for --metrics="auto", pseudoanonymous metrics are sent when the user is logged in
### Added

- <!-- /21045 -->

### Fixed

- Jira <!-- pull/21132  -->

## üíª Semgrep Code

### Added

- Improved handling of `tsconfig.json` in instances where multiple, separately rooted source directories with their own `tsconfig.json` configurations were previously treated as a single project. These directories are now treated as their own TypeScript project, which should result in better name/module resolution.
- Improved handling of `include`,` exclude and files properties in tsconfig.json. Projects which use more than one tsconfig in a given directory which apply to different sets of files under that directory should see improvements in name/module resolution. (code-7798-a)

### Fixed

- Fix a bug introduced in Semgrep 1.120.0 causing cross-file analyses to run out of memory due to too many parallel jobs. The default setting had been accidentally set to the number of available CPUs which is often too much in cross-file mode. It's now back to `-j1`, which you can override. 
- CLI: Fixed a bug where `--disable-nosem` was not sending findings from `nosem`-annotated lines of code to Semgrep AppSec Platform. `--disable-nosem` now correctly sends findings, if any, from `nosem`-annotated lines, to the Platform.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Semgrep Supply Chain

### Added

- Semgrep can now scan `composer.lock` files for the licenses of PHP dependencies. Through this feature, you can configure Semgrep to block or leave a comment on pull requests or merge requests, depending on the license of the dependency that the PR or MR is adding.

### Changed

- Improved Supply Chain scan output and logging.

### Fixed

- Semgrep now scans large manifests and lockfiles, which were previously ignored due to semgrep's default file size filtering. This ensures that your lockfiles can be scanned for dependencies and their relationships. This fixes a regression introduced in 1.117.0. 
- Fixed a bug where Supply Chain reachability rules which match multiple dependencies could produce reachable findings on transitive dependencies even when the actually used direct dependency was not vulnerable.

## ü§ñ Semgrep Assistant

<!-- katie -->

## üîê Semgrep Secrets
