# Click to fix with breaking change guidance



What the workflow look like (Semgrep-agnostic)

1. While performing remediation (that is, the AppSec engineer has already decided on the findings they want to fix), the AppSec engineer examines the click-to-fix guidance.
1. AppSec engineer triggers a PR based on the guidance - **what** does the guidance provide?
1. Developer receives a PR
  1. What are the mechanics of this PR? Does it have to be merged by X date? Is it just going to sit there? 
  1. What is IN this PR, does the developer have to do anything with it?
