# License scanning

[TODO]make link from dependency search

Semgrep Supply Chain's **license scanning** feature enables you to explicitly allow or disallow (block) a package's use in your repository based on its license. For example, your company policy may disallow the use of packages with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC-BY-NC) license.


:::info
For GitHub Actions users, Semgrep Supply Chain blocks PRs (pull requests) or MRs (merge requests) by failing the CI job. Ensure that the PR is fully blocked by enforcing [branch protections]().
