Scanning third-party code with Semgrep Supply Chain may require additional steps, such as generating a lock file that it can parse in continuous integration (CI).

The documents in this category describe how to set up Semgrep Supply Chain for specific lock files or CI providers, to ensure that your Semgrep Supply Chain deployment functions as intended.
