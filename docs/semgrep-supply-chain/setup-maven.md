# Setting up Semgrep Supply Chain with Apache Maven (Java)

Semgrep Supply Chain does not read `pom.xml` files to parse Maven projects. Instead it parses a dependency tree generated by Maven (`mvn`). 

The **general steps** to enable Semgrep Supply Chain to correctly parse Maven projects are as follows:

<ol>
    <li>Generate a file outlining the project's dependency tree by adding the following command to your build pipeline:<br />
    <pre class="language-bash">mvn dependency:tree -DoutputFile=maven_dep_tree.txt</pre>
    For specific steps to add the command into your build pipeline, refer to your CI provider's documentation.</li>
    <li>For each <code>pom.xml</code> file with dependencies you want to scan, create additional dependency trees in their respective directories. Semgrep Supply Chain can detect and parse them all.</li>
    <li>Run the Semgrep workflow, action, or step after the dependency tree or trees have been generated.</li>
</ol>

:::caution
* Ensure that Maven is installed in the build environment that is used to generate the dependency trees.
* Ensure that you generate dependency trees before running Semgrep.
:::

You can perform the general steps in a local environment for testing. The following screenshot displays the commands running in a local environment:

## Scanning Apache Maven projects with specific CI providers

This section describes steps to set up Apache Maven with specific CI providers.

## GitHub Actions

To successfully run a Semgrep Supply Chain scan in GitHub Actions, the GitHub Actions workflow must generate all dependency trees in one job and then run Semgrep after. 

### Sample GitHub Actions Maven workflow

<Tabs
    defaultValue="gha-multiple"
    values={[
    {label: 'Multiple pom.xml files', value: 'gha-multiple'},
    {label: 'Single pom.xml file', value: 'gha-single'},
    ]}
>

<TabItem value='gha-multiple'>

In the following code snippet, dependency trees are shared between the two jobs through a zip file that gathers all the lock files and, in the next job, unzips the lock files and runs Semgrep as usual.

```yaml
on: 
  workflow_dispatch: 
  pull_request: {}
  push:
    branches:
    - master
    paths:
    - .github/workflows/semgrep.yml
name: Semgrep
jobs:
  buildmavenDepTree: 
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up JDK 11
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '11'
          distribution: 'temurin'
      - name: Build Dependency Tree
        # The mvn command traverses the repository and generates a dependency tree for each pom.xml file
        run: mvn dependency:tree -DoutputFile=maven_dep_tree.txt -Dmaven.test.skip=true
      - name: Create Zip File
        run: find . -type f -name 'maven_dep_tree.txt' -exec zip -r archive.zip {} +
      - name: Upload Dependency Zip    
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: zipfile
          path: archive.zip
  semgrep:
    needs: buildmavenDepTree
    name: Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    env:
      SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN }}
    container:
      image: returntocorp/semgrep
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Download artifact from the previous job
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: zipfile    
      - name: Semgrep Scan  
        run: |
          unzip -o archive.zip
          semgrep ci
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='gha-single'>

The following code snippet is intended for repositories with a single `pom.xml` file.

```yaml
on: 
  workflow_dispatch: 
  pull_request: {}
  push:
    branches:
    - main
    paths:
    - .github/workflows/semgrep.yml
name: Semgrep
jobs:
  buildmavenDepTree: 
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn --batch-mode --update-snapshots package
      - name: Build Dependency Tree
        run: mvn dependency:tree -DoutputFile=maven_dep_tree.txt
      - name: Upload Dependency Tree Artifact     
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: mavendeptree
          path: maven_dep_tree.txt
  semgrep:
    needs: buildmavenDepTree
    name: Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    env:
      SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN }}
    container:
      image: returntocorp/semgrep
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Download artifact from previous job
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: mavendeptree 
      - run: semgrep ci 
```
</TabItem>
