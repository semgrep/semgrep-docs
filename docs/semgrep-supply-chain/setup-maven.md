# Setting up Semgrep Supply Chain with Apache Maven (Java)

Semgrep Supply Chain does not read `pom.xml` files to parse Maven projects. Instead it parses a dependency tree generated by Maven (`mvn`). Perform the following steps to enable Semgrep Supply Chain to correctly parse Maven projects:

<ol>
    <li>Generate a file outlining the project's dependency tree by adding the following command to your build pipeline:<br />
    <pre class="language-bash">mvn dependency:tree -DoutputFile=maven_dep_tree.txt</pre>
    For specific steps to add the command into your build pipeline, refer to your CI provider's documentation.</li>
    <li>For each <code>pom.xml</code> file with dependencies you want to scan, create additional dependency trees in their respective directories. Semgrep Supply Chain can detect and parse them all.</li>
    <li>Run the Semgrep workflow, action, or step after the dependency tree or trees have been generated.</li>
</ol>

:::caution
* Ensure that Maven is installed in the build environment that is used to generate the dependency trees.
* Ensure that you generate dependency trees before running Semgrep.
:::

You can run the above commands in a local environment to test its behavior. The following screenshot displays the commands running in a local environment:
