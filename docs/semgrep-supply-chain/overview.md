# Conceptual overview of Semgrep Supply Chain

<SscIntro />

_Figure 1_. Semgrep Supply Chain Vulnerabilities page.

Semgrep Supply Chain parses lock files for a list of dependencies, then scans your codebase using **rules **written with Semgrep's pattern syntax. Supply Chain rules specify the following:

* The range of versions that contain the dependency's vulnerability.
* A pattern for vulnerable code, such as passing in unsanitized data.
* The severity of the vulnerability.

Semgrep Supply Chain generates a **finding** when it detects a match. If the dependency's version is within the range and finds the matching code within your codebase, the finding is **reachable**.

A finding is **unreachable** if the dependency contains a known vulnerability, but the vulnerable matching code is not used in your codebase.

A finding is **undetermined** if Semgrep detects a match for the dependency in the vulnerable version range, but does not have a reachability rule for this vulnerability. This is most common with older or lower severity vulnerabilities.

Undetermined findings are generated by Semgrep Supply Chain **[lockfile-only](/semgrep-supply-chain/glossary/#lockfile-only-rules)** rules, which are rules that do not perform reachability analysis. These findings are generated by checking the dependency's version in its lock or manifest file against versions with known vulnerabilities. These rules are on par with [GitHub Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot).

In Semgrep Cloud Platform, specific findings of a dependency and code match are called **usages**. Usages are grouped by their **vulnerability**. Vulnerabilities in Semgrep Supply Chain typically have a CVE number corresponding to the record in the [CVE Program](https://www.cve.org/About/Overview).

Semgrep Cloud Platform also includes a list of **Advisories** for reference. Advisories include all vulnerabilities covered by Semgrep Supply Chain, regardless of whether the related dependency is used in scanned code.

## Language support

Refer to [Supported languages](/docs/supported-languages#semgrep-supply-chain) to see all languages supported by Semgrep Supply Chain.

## Transitive dependencies and reachability analysis

See [SSC glossary > Transitivity](/docs/semgrep-supply-chain/glossary/#transitive-or-indirect-dependency) for a definition of a transitive dependency.

* Semgrep Supply Chain does **not** perform reachability analysis for transitive dependencies. This means we do not scan the source code of your dependencies to determine if their dependencies may produce a reachable finding in the code.
* Semgrep Supply Chain supports scanning for transitive or indirect dependencies for all of its [supported languages](/docs/supported-languages#semgrep-supply-chain). Findings are collected and displayed in **Semgrep Cloud Platform** > **Supply Chain**.
* In most cases, Semgrep Supply Chain generates **reachable findings** for **direct dependencies**. However, there are certain dependencies that are vulnerable simply through their inclusion in a codebase. Semgrep Supply Chain generates reachable findings for these types of dependencies even if they are transitive dependencies.

:::info
In some package ecosystems, it's possible to use a transitive dependency in your code as if it were a direct dependency. This is very uncommon, but Semgrep does scan for these usages with reachability rules if they are available, and will mark transitive dependencies as "unreachable" if they are not directly used.
