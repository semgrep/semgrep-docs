# Overview

_Figure 1_. Semgrep Supply Chain Vulnerabilities page.

Supply Chain parses lock files for a list of dependencies, then scans your codebase using [rules](/running-rules/) that specify the following information:

* The dependency versions that contain a vulnerability;
* The pattern for the vulnerable code that Semgrep compares against your code;
* The severity of the vulnerability.

The following diagram shows the relationship between a Supply Chain rule, the codebase scanned, and its lock file:

## Supply Chain findings

If Semgrep Supply Chain determines that the codebase leverages a package containing a vulnerability, it generates a **finding**. If Supply Chain also determines that there's a code pattern in the codebase that matches the vulnerability definition, then the finding is flagged as **reachable** (otherwise, it is **unreachable**).

If Semgrep detects the use of a vulnerable version of a dependency, but it doesn't have a reachability rule, then the finding is **undetermined** (this is most common with older vulnerabilities or vulnerabilities with lower severity levels).

Undetermined findings are generated by Supply Chain's **[lockfile-only](/semgrep-supply-chain/glossary/#lockfile-only-rules)** rules, which are rules that do not perform reachability analysis. These findings are generated by checking the dependency's version listed in the lock file or manifest against a list of versions with known vulnerabilities.

## View findings in Semgrep Cloud Platform

You can view Semgrep Supply Chain's findings in Semgrep Cloud Platform (SCP).

In SCP, specific dependency and code match findings are called **usages**, which are grouped by vulnerability. For each vulnerability, SCP also displays a CVE number corresponding to the [CVE program record](https://www.cve.org/About/Overview).

### Advisories

Semgrep Cloud platform also displays **advisories**, which provide information about all vulnerabilities covered by Supply Chain, regardless of whether your code leverages the related dependency.

## Transitive dependencies and reachability analysis

A [transitive dependency](/docs/semgrep-supply-chain/glossary/#transitive-or-indirect-dependency) (also known as an indirect dependency) is a dependency of a dependency. Regarding transitive dependencies, please note that:

* Semgrep Supply Chain scans transitive dependencies for projects written in any of its [supported languages](/docs/supported-languages#semgrep-supply-chain). You can view findings in the Semgrep Cloud Platform under **Supply Chain**.

* Semgrep Supply Chain does *not* perform reachability analysis for transitive dependencies. This means that Supply Chain doesn't scan the source code of your project's dependencies to determine if their dependencies produce a reachable finding in your code.

* In most cases, Semgrep Supply Chain generates **reachable findings** for **direct dependencies**. However, certain dependencies are vulnerable simply through their inclusion in a codebase. Semgrep Supply Chain generates reachable findings for these types of dependencies, even if they are transitive dependencies.

* Some package ecosystems allow the use of a transitive dependency as if it were a direct dependency. Though this feature is uncommon, Semgrep Supply Chain can scan for such usage and flag transitive dependencies as unreachable if not used directly.
