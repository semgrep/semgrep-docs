## Identify open source security vulnerabilities

Semgrep Supply Chain detects [security
vulnerabilities](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/full-listing) in your codebase
introduced by open-source dependencies using high-signal rules, which are
instructions Semgrep uses detect patterns in code, to determine the
vulnerability's [reachability](/semgrep-supply-chain/glossary/#reachability).

To do this, Semgrep Supply Chain parses **lockfiles** for a list of dependencies,
then scans your codebase using rules that specify the
following information:

* The dependency versions that contain a vulnerability
* The pattern for the vulnerable code that Semgrep compares against your code
* The severity of the vulnerability

The following diagram shows the relationship between a Semgrep Supply Chain
rule, the codebase scanned, and its lockfile:

### Types of Semgrep Supply Chain findings

If Semgrep Supply Chain determines that the codebase leverages a package
containing a vulnerability, it generates a **finding**. If Semgrep Supply Chain
also determines that there's a code pattern in the codebase that matches the
vulnerability definition, then the finding is flagged as **reachable**
(otherwise, it is **unreachable**).

If Semgrep Supply Chain detects the use of a vulnerable version of a dependency,
but it doesn't have a reachability rule, then the finding is **undetermined**
(this is most common with vulnerabilities discovered prior to May 2022 or vulnerabilities with lower
severity levels).

Undetermined findings are generated by Semgrep Supply Chain's
**[lockfile-only](/semgrep-supply-chain/glossary/#lockfile-only-rules)** rules,
which are rules that do not perform reachability analysis. These findings are
generated by checking the dependency's version listed in the lockfile or
manifest against a list of versions with known vulnerabilities. These rules are
on par with [GitHub Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot).

Specific dependency and code match findings are called **usages**, which are
grouped by vulnerability. For each vulnerability, SCP also displays a CVE number
corresponding to the [CVE program record](https://www.cve.org/About/Overview).

### Transitive dependencies and reachability analysis

A [transitive
dependency](/docs/semgrep-supply-chain/glossary/#transitive-or-indirect-dependency),
also known as an indirect dependency, is a dependency of a dependency. Semgrep
Supply Chain scans transitive dependencies for security vulnerabilities, but it
does *not* perform reachability analysis. This means that Semgrep Supply Chain
doesn't check the source code of your project's dependencies to determine if
their dependencies produce a reachable finding in your code.

However, some dependencies are vulnerable simply through their inclusion in a
codebase; in such cases, Semgrep Supply Chain generates reachable findings
involving these dependencies, even if they're transitive, not direct,
dependencies.

Some package ecosystems allow the use of a transitive dependency as if it were a
direct dependency. Though this feature is uncommon, Semgrep Supply Chain can
scan for such usage and flag transitive dependencies as unreachable if not used
directly.

## Software bill of materials

Semgrep Supply Chain can [generate a software bill of materials
(SBOM)](/semgrep-supply-chain/sbom), a complete inventory of your
third-party or open source components to assist you with your auditing procedures.

## Dependency search

Semgrep Supply Chain's dependency search feature allows you to query for
dependencies in your codebase; it can detect direct and transitive dependencies
in any repository on which you have run a full scan. The results list the dependency, along
with all of the repositories that use the dependency.

## License compliance

The [license compliance](/semgrep-supply-chain/license-compliance) feature
ensures that you're only using open source packages whose licensing meets your
organization's requirements.

## Next steps

Semgrep Supply Chain automatically scans [repositories that you add to Semgrep Cloud Platform](/semgrep-cloud-platform/getting-started/#starting-a-sast-and-sca-scan-on-a-remote-repository).

* After every scan, you can view your findings by [logging in to Semgrep Cloud
  Platform (SCP)](https://semgrep.dev/login) and navigating to [**Supply
  Chain**](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/supply-chain).
* To support your security and business goals, you can [customize how Semgrep
  Supply Chain scans your dependencies](/semgrep-supply-chain/getting-started).
* The SCP has features to support the [triage and
  remediation](/semgrep-supply-chain/triage-remediation) of your findings.
