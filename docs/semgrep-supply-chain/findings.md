# Supply Chain findings

Semgrep Supply Chain generates a **finding** when a rule matches a piece of code in your codebase. You can use Semgrep AppSec Platform's [**Supply Chain** page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/supply-chain) to view all of the findings generated by Semgrep Supply Chain after it scans your codebase.

In additional to viewing your findings, you can use the **Supply Chain > Dependencies** tab to view information about your dependencies across all onboarded repositories.

:::info Prerequisite
At least one repository that scans for dependencies through Semgrep Supply Chain. See [Scan third-party dependencies](/semgrep-supply-chain/getting-started).
:::

## View findings

Once Semgrep Supply Chain successfully scans your repository, you can view and export information regarding the findings presented in Semgrep AppSec Platform using the **Supply Chain** page. To view your findings in Semgrep AppSec Platform:

1. Log in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. In the **Navigation bar**, click **[Supply Chain](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/supply-chain)**.

By default, Semgrep displays your **Priority** findings. Priority findings are defined as findings that:

- Have a severity level of **critical** or **high**
- Are **reachable**

You can switch to the **All** tab at any point to view all findings identified by Semgrep Supply Chain. Both the **Priority** findings view and the **All** findings view display high-level information about your findings. Each finding in the list includes:

  - The name and brief description of the rule used to generate the finding.
  - The name of the project.
  - A link to the commit where the finding was first identified.
  - A link to the lines of code where the finding was most recently seen.

## Filter findings

Regardless of whether you use the **Priority** findings view or the **All** findings view, there are multiple grouping and filtering options available to you.

### Time period

<TimePeriodFilters />

### Project

The **Project** filter allows you to search for findings associated with the selected projects.

### Status

The **Status** filter allows you to search for findings in the selected statuses, which are the triage states of the findings:

* **Open**: Findings for which there have been no triage or remediation action.
* **Reviewing**: Findings that require more investigation to determine what the next steps should be.
* **To fix**: Findings for which you have decided to fix. Commonly used to indicate that these findings are tracked in Jira or assigned to developers for further work.
* **Provisionally ignored**:
* **Ignored**: Vulnerabilities that have been triaged as **Ignored** by the user. You can filter findings with a status of **Ignored** further by reason: **False positive**, **Acceptable risk**, **No time to fix**, or **No triage reason**.
* **Closed**: Vulnerabilities that are no longer detected after a scan. This typically means that the dependency containing the vulnerability has been updated. Semgrep Supply Chain automatically checks if the dependency has been updated and sets the vulnerability's status as **Fixed**.

> You can set the **Fixing** and **Reviewing** statuses only if you are a [Jira beta](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-appsec-platform/jira) participant.

### Additional filters

Semgrep offers additional filters that you can use to narrow down your results. The following filters are available:

| Filter | Description |
| - | - |
| **Severity** | The severity of a finding. Filters are based on the severity of a vulnerability. Semgrep Supply Chain rules use severity values set by the source of the rule, such as [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories).  |
| [**Reachability**](#reachability) | The finding's exposure, or whether it is reachable. |
| [**EPSS probability**](#epss-probability) | The finding's [Exploit prediction scoring system (EPSS) probability](https://www.first.org/epss/). |
| **Upgrade guidance (beta)** | The impact of a dependency upgrade on your project as determined by Assistant. |
| **Dependencies** | The name of the dependency involved. |
| **Advisory** | The vulnerabilities' ID number, such as CVE, GHSA, MAL, or keyword. |
| **Malicious dependency** | Whether the finding is for a malicious dependency |
| **Project tags** | The tags associated with the project. |
| **Assistant file risk level** | Filter by the risk level determined by Semgrep Assistant. |

### EPSS probability

<EpssTypes />

### Reachability

The finding's exposure to potential attacks, or whether it is reachable.

<ReachabilityTypes />

### Transitivity

The transitivity of the finding: 

<TransitivityTypes />

### Upgrade guidance (beta)

The impact of a dependency upgrade on your project as determined by Assistant:

- **Safe**: There are unlikely to be breaking changes.
- **Breaking**: Introduces breaking changes; code modifications required.

## Group and sort findings

You can view findings individually or grouped by the rule that identified the finding. 

By default, Semgrep displays your findings using the **Group by Rule** view. This view shows your findings grouped by the rule Semgrep used to match the code. Your findings are shown sorted **by severity**, but you can opt to sort **by number of findings** for a given rule.

A specific finding in the code is called a **usage**. Vulnerability entries are sorted as cards by severity from critical to low, then from oldest to newest.
