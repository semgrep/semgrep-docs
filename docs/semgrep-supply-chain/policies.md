# Manage policies (beta)

Use Supply Chain policies to define the conditions in which developers are **notified** of a finding through a comment, or potentially **blocked** from merging their pull or merge request (PR or MR). This feature helps you manage noise and ensures that developers are only notified or potentially blocked based on the conditions you set.

This feature enables you to configure the following:

- **Scope**: These are the projects (repositories) that are affected by the policy.
- **Conditions**: The conditions under which **actions** are performed. These conditions are typically attributes of a finding such as severity or reachability. 
- **Actions**: Actions that are performed on the defined scope when conditions are met.

You can create as many policies as you need.

## Feature maturity

The Supply Chain policies feature is in **private beta**. To apply to this beta, reach out to [<i class="fa-regular fa-envelope"></i> support@semgrep.com](mailto:support@semgrep.com).

## Prerequisites

This feature requires the `semgrep:latest` Docker image or at least version 1.101.0 of the Semgrep CLI tool.

## View your policies

Only **admins** can view, create, edit, or delete policies.

1. Sign in to [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
1. From the navigation menu, click **Rules** to expand the drop-down box, then click **Policies**.
1. Click **Supply Chain**. This takes you to the Supply Chain policies tab.

## Create a policy

1. From the Supply Chain policies tab, Click **Create policy**.
1. Provide a **Policy name**.
1. Define the scope of the policy:
    1. Click the drop-down box to select between **All Projects**, **Project**, or **Project tag**.
    1. For **Project** or **Project tag** values, a second drop-down box appears. Choose the **projects** or **project tags** to finish defining the scope.
1. Define the conditions of the policy by selecting either **Reachable** or **Critical or high severity, reachable, upgrades available**. Selecting **Reachable** typically results in more findings shown to developers.
1. Define the actions of the policy. You can choose to **Leave a comment** or **Block and leave a comment**.
1. Click **Save**. This brings you back to the Supply Chain policies tab.

After creating a policy, it is automatically **enabled** and will be applied to subsequent scans.
