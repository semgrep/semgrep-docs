# Getting started with Semgrep OSS Engine

The Semgrep OSS Engine is the foundation of Semgrep. With it, you can detect bugs, style violations, security issues, and more by scanning your code locally using [community-contributed rules](https://semgrep.dev/explore) as well as your own custom rules.

## Installing and running Semgrep locally

Install and run the [Semgrep command-line interface](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/) (CLI) to scan your code locally. Semgrep OSS Engine runs offline on uncompiled code. **No code leaves your computer**.

:::info Prerequisite
Semgrep CLI requires Python 3.7 or later.
:::

To install and run Semgrep OSS Engine, use one of the following options:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="macOS"
    values={[
    {label: 'macOS', value: 'macOS'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'Linux'},
    {label: 'Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)', value: 'Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)'},
    {label: 'Docker', value: 'Docker'},
    ]}
>

<TabItem value='macOS'>

  1. Install:
      ```bash
      brew install semgrep
      ```

      Alternatively:

      ```bash
      python3 -m pip install semgrep
      ```

  2. Confirm installation:
      ```sh
      semgrep --version
      ```
  3. Run recommended Semgrep Registry rules:
      <pre class="language-bash"><code>semgrep --config=auto <span className="placeholder">PATH/TO/SRC</span></code></pre>
      Substitute the optional placeholder <code><span className="placeholder">PATH/TO/SRC</span></code> with the path to your source code.


</TabItem>

<TabItem value='Linux'>

  1. Install:
      ```bash
      python3 -m pip install semgrep
      ```

  2. Confirm installation:
      ```sh
      semgrep --version
      ```

  3. Run recommended Semgrep Registry rules:
      <pre class="language-bash"><code>semgrep --config=auto <span className="placeholder">PATH/TO/SRC</span></code></pre>
      Substitute the optional placeholder <code><span className="placeholder">PATH/TO/SRC</span></code> with the path to your source code.


</TabItem>

<TabItem value='Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)'>

  1. Install:
      ```bash
      python3 -m pip install semgrep
      ```

  2. Confirm installation:
      ```sh
      semgrep --version
      ```

  3. Run recommended Semgrep Registry rules:
      <pre class="language-bash"><code>semgrep --config=auto <span className="placeholder">PATH/TO/SRC</span></code></pre>
      Substitute the optional placeholder <code><span className="placeholder">PATH/TO/SRC</span></code> with the path to your source code.


</TabItem>

<TabItem value='Docker'>

  1. Pull latest image locally:
     ```sh
     docker pull returntocorp/semgrep
     ```
   
  2. Confirm version:
      ```sh
      docker run --rm returntocorp/semgrep semgrep --version
      ```

  3. Run recommended Semgrep Registry rules:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/src" returntocorp/semgrep semgrep --config=auto
    ```

    The provided `-v` option mounts the current directory into the container to be scanned. Change directories locally or provide a specific local directory in the command to scan a different directory.


</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::note
- By default, when Semgrep Registry is used, Semgrep collects [usage metrics](./metrics.md).
- If you install Semgrep through Homebrew, ensure that you have added Homebrew to your PATH. See [My Mac .apps donâ€™t find Homebrew utilities!](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#my-mac-apps-dont-find-homebrew-utilities) in Homebrew documentation.

### Next steps

By completing this guide, you are now familiar with a simple use of Semgrep. Here are some additional resources to follow:

- Follow tutorials on [Learn Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/learn/) to learn about Semgrep interactively.
- See [Running rules](./running-rules.md) to try out and understand more about Semgrep rules.
- See [CLI Reference](./cli-reference.md) for command line options and exit codes.
- Explore the Semgrep [Rules Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) to add rules to your project or [writing a rule](./writing-rules/overview.md).

## Testing Semgrep on vulnerable repositories

The following community projects are designed to test code scanners and teach security concepts. Try cloning and scanning them with Semgrep.

<details><summary>Expand for sample projects! ðŸŽ‰</summary>
<p>

```sh
# juice-shop, a vulnerable Node.js + Express app:
git clone https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop
cd juice-shop
semgrep --config=auto

# Or if you don't have Semgrep installed, replace the semgrep command with:
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/juice-shop:/src" returntocorp/semgrep semgrep --config p/security-audit /src

# Try railsgoat, a vulnerable Ruby on Rails app:
git clone https://github.com/OWASP/railsgoat
cd railsgoat
semgrep --config=auto

# govwa, a vulnerable Go app:
git clone https://github.com/0c34/govwa
cd govwa
semgrep --config=auto 

# Vulnerable-Flask-App, vulnerable Python + Flask:
git clone https://github.com/we45/Vulnerable-Flask-App
cd Vulnerable-Flask-App
semgrep --config=auto 

# WebGoat, a vulnerable Java + Spring app:
git clone https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat
cd WebGoat
semgrep --config=auto 
```

</p>
</details>

## Run Semgrep continuously

Semgrep is at its best when used to continuously scan code. Check out [Semgrep in CI](semgrep-ci/overview.md/) to learn how to get results where you already work: GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Jira, and more. To get results even earlier in the development process, such as in a Git pre-commit hook or VS Code, check the available [Semgrep extensions](/extensions/overview/).

Check out [Semgrep Cloud Platform](https://semgrep.dev/manage) (SCP) to integrate Semgrep scans into your CI environment with PR or MR comments, monitor progress, host private rules (Team and Enterprise tiers), and much more! 

## Logging into Semgrep Cloud Platform

:::tip Benefits of logging in to Semgrep Cloud Platform
Logging into Semgrep Cloud Platform (SCP) in your Semgrep CLI interface enables you to:

- Send findings from your local scans to SCP for findings triage.
- Quickly configure local scans to run either rules from your Rule board or a different set of rules and rulesets. 
- For Team or Enterprise users: scan code using Pro rules from the CLI.
:::

To log in to SCP:

1. Create an account by clicking the link: [Sign in to Semgrep Cloud Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. In your command line, enter the following command:
    ```sh
    semgrep login
    ```
3. Click the link provided in your terminal and follow the instructions.

## Updating Semgrep

We [release new Semgrep versions](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases) often! See [Updating](./upgrading.md) for more details.
