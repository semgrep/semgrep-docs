# Getting started


## Run Semgrep locally

Start by running [Semgrep](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/) locally to scan your code. It runs offline on uncompiled code: **no code leaves your machine**.

Install Semgrep using Homebrew or pip, or run without installation via Docker:

For macOS:

```sh
brew install semgrep
```

For Ubuntu / Windows via WSL / Linux / macOS:

```sh
python3 -m pip install semgrep
```

To try Semgrep without installation run via Docker:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/src" returntocorp/semgrep --config=auto
```

Confirm installation and run both a simple ‚Äúgrep-like‚Äù rule and the auto ruleset:

```sh
# Confirm installation by running --help. It should print to your terminal.
semgrep --help

# Check for Python == where the left and right sides are the same (often a bug)
semgrep -e '$X == $X' --lang=py path/to/src

# Automatically survey languages and frameworks and run recommended Registry rules
semgrep --config=auto path/to/src
```

See [CLI Reference](../cli-usage/) for command line options and exit codes.

When the Registry is used for any ruleset (like the auto ruleset above), [usage metrics](../metrics) are collected.

Visit [Running rules](../running-rules/) to learn more or try Semgrep on known vulnerable test projects:

<details><summary>Expand for sample projects! üéâ</summary>
<p>

These community projects are designed to test code scanners and teach security concepts. Try cloning and scanning them with Semgrep.

```sh
# juice-shop, a vulnerable Node.js + Express app
git clone https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop
cd juice-shop
semgrep --config=auto

# railsgoat, a vulnerable Ruby on Rails app
git clone https://github.com/OWASP/railsgoat
cd railsgoat
semgrep --config=auto

# govwa, a vulnerable Go app
git clone https://github.com/0c34/govwa
cd govwa
semgrep --config=auto 

# vulnerable Python + Flask app
git clone https://github.com/we45/Vulnerable-Flask-App
cd Vulnerable-Flask-App
semgrep --config=auto 

# WebGoat, a vulnerable Java + Spring app
git clone https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat
cd WebGoat
semgrep --config=auto 
```

## Write a rule

Once Semgrep is running locally, see the [Semgrep Tutorial](https://semgrep.dev/learn) to quickly learn how to write precise rules.

Semgrep rules can cover a wide range of use cases:

- Automating code review comments
- Detecting secure coding violations
- Detecting API routes, database models, or similar code segments
- Identifying authentication violations
- Lightweight vulnerability detection
- Scanning configuration files
- And more! Check out more use cases [here](../writing-rules/rule-ideas/).


Visit [Writing Rules > Getting started](../writing-rules/overview/) for an in-depth guide and reference material.

This rule is used to find and discourage `print(...)` in production code. You can edit this rule here or visit the [Playground](https://semgrep.dev/editor) to write and deploy your own rule.

## Run Semgrep continuously

Finally, Semgrep is at its best when used to continuously scan code.
Check out [Semgrep CI](../semgrep-ci/overview/) to learn how to get results where you already work:
GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Jira, and more.
To get results even earlier in the development process,
such as in a Git pre-commit hook or VS Code,
check the available [Semgrep extensions](../extensions/).

For teams running Semgrep on multiple projects, see [Semgrep App](https://semgrep.dev/manage). Its free and paid tiers let users:

1. Centrally define code standards
2. Monitor the impact of standards
3. Host private rules
4. Push notifications to 3rd-party services

## Upgrading

We [release new Semgrep versions](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases) often! See [upgrading](../upgrading/) for more details.
