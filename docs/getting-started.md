# Getting started with Semgrep

Detect security issues, vulnerable dependencies, and more by scanning your code with Semgrep. Semgrep performs both SAST (Static application security testing) and SCA (Software composition analysis) scans.

The following guide walks you through:
* Installing Semgrep in your computer locally.
* Running a single scan for both SAST and SCA.
* Sending results to [Semgrep Cloud Platform](/semgrep-cloud-platform/getting-started) for triage and analysis.

:::info
* **Code is not uploaded.** Only **findings** are sent to Semgrep Cloud Platform. 
:::

## Installing and running Semgrep locally

<!-- Commenting out for the interim
Install and run the [Semgrep command-line interface](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/) (CLI) to scan your code locally. Semgrep OSS Engine runs offline on uncompiled code. **No code leaves your computer**.
-->

:::info Prerequisite
The Semgrep command-line tool requires Python 3.8 or later.
:::

To install and run Semgrep, use one of the following options:

You have just finished installing and running a Semgrep scan. Use [Semgrep Cloud Platform](/semgrep-cloud-platform/getting-started) to triage your findings and view vulnerabilities.

:::tip 
* You can also run `semgrep scan --config=auto` for **offline-only SAST scans**. No SCA scan is performed with this command. 
:::

:::note
- By default, when Semgrep Registry is used, Semgrep collects [usage metrics](./metrics.md).
- If you install Semgrep through Homebrew, ensure that you have added Homebrew to your PATH. See [My Mac .apps donâ€™t find Homebrew utilities!](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#my-mac-apps-dont-find-homebrew-utilities) in Homebrew documentation.

- See [Running rules](./running-rules.md) to try out and understand more about Semgrep rules.
- See [CLI Reference](./cli-reference.md) for command line options and exit codes.
- Explore the Semgrep [Rules Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) to add rules to your project or [writing a rule](./writing-rules/overview.md).
- Read the [Trail of Bits Automated Testing Handbook](https://appsec.guide/) to learn about configuring and optimizing security tools, including Semgrep.

## Testing Semgrep on vulnerable repositories

The following community projects are designed to test code scanners and teach security concepts. Try cloning and scanning them with Semgrep.

<details><summary>Expand for sample projects! ðŸŽ‰</summary>
<p>

```sh
# juice-shop, a vulnerable Node.js + Express app:
git clone https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop
cd juice-shop
semgrep --config=auto

# Or if you don't have Semgrep installed, replace the semgrep command with:
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/juice-shop:/src" returntocorp/semgrep semgrep --config p/security-audit /src

# Try railsgoat, a vulnerable Ruby on Rails app:
git clone https://github.com/OWASP/railsgoat
cd railsgoat
semgrep --config=auto

# govwa, a vulnerable Go app:
git clone https://github.com/0c34/govwa
cd govwa
semgrep --config=auto 

# Vulnerable-Flask-App, vulnerable Python + Flask:
git clone https://github.com/we45/Vulnerable-Flask-App
cd Vulnerable-Flask-App
semgrep --config=auto 

# WebGoat, a vulnerable Java + Spring app:
git clone https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat
cd WebGoat
semgrep --config=auto 
```

</p>
</details>

## Run Semgrep continuously

Semgrep is at its best when used to continuously scan code. Check out [Semgrep in CI](semgrep-ci/overview.md/) to learn how to get results where you already work: GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Jira, and more. To get results even earlier in the development process, such as in a Git pre-commit hook or VS Code, check the available [Semgrep extensions](/extensions/overview/).

Check out [Semgrep Cloud Platform](https://semgrep.dev/manage) (SCP) to integrate Semgrep scans into your CI environment with PR or MR comments, monitor progress, host private rules (Team and Enterprise tiers), and much more! 

## Updating Semgrep

We [release new Semgrep versions](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases) often! See [Updating](./upgrading.md) for more details.
