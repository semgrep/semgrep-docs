# Run Semgrep locally

Use Semgrep locally to scan specific files or your entire codebase, choosing one-off "grep-like" patterns or existing rules.

To install Semgrep use Homebrew or pip, or run without installation via Docker:

```sh
# For macOS
$ brew install semgrep

# For Ubuntu/WSL/Linux
$ python3 -m pip install semgrep

# To try Semgrep without installation run via Docker
$ docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/src" returntocorp/semgrep --help
```

To confirm installation and get an overview of Semgrepâ€™s functionality run with `--help`:

```sh
$ semgrep --help
```

Once installed, Semgrep can run with single rules or entire rulesets. Visit [Running rules](running-rules.md) to learn more or try the following:

```sh
##############################
# Try Semgrep on your own code
##############################

# Check for Python == where the left and right hand sides are the same (often a bug)
$ semgrep -e '$X == $X' --lang=py path/to/src

# Run the r2c-ci ruleset (with rules for many languages) on your own code!
$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/p/r2c-ci path/to/src

# Run and centrally manage Semgrep CI

Semgrep is at its best when used to continuously scan code. Visit [Integrations](integrations.md) to learn how to get results where you already work: GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Jira, VS Code, and more.

For teams running Semgrep on multiple projects, visit [Manage](https://semgrep.dev/manage). Semgrep provides free infrastructure to:

1. Centrally define code standards for your projects
3. Monitor the impact of your standards
4. Host private rules
