# Getting started with Semgrep CLI

## Running Semgrep locally

Start by running [Semgrep](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/) locally to scan your code. Semgrep runs offline on uncompiled code. **No code leaves your computer**.

:::info Prerequisite
Semgrep requires Python 3.7 or later.
:::

1. Install Semgrep. Use one of the following options depending on your system and preference:
    - For macOS:
        ```sh
        brew install semgrep
        ```
    - For Ubuntu, Windows through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), Linux, macOS:
        ```sh
        python3 -m pip install semgrep
        ```
    - To try out Semgrep without installation you may run it through Docker:
        ```sh
        docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/src" returntocorp/semgrep semgrep --config=auto
        ```
2. Confirm installation by running a simple search pattern. For example, run the following command:
    ```sh
    semgrep --pattern '127.$A.$B.$C' --lang generic /etc/hosts
    ```
3. Run recommended Semgrep Registry rules:
    <pre class="language-bash"><code>semgrep --config=auto <span className="placeholder">PATH/TO/SRC</span></code></pre>
    Substitute the optional placeholder <code><span className="placeholder">PATH/TO/SRC</span></code> with the path to your source code.

:::note
By default, when Semgrep Registry is used, Semgrep collects [usage metrics](./metrics.md).

### Next steps

By completing this guide, you are now familiar with a simple use of Semgrep. Here are some additional resources to follow:

- Follow tutorials on [Learn Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/learn/) to learn about Semgrep interactively.
- See [Running rules](./running-rules.md) to try out and understand more about Semgrep rules.
- See [CLI Reference](./cli-reference.md) for command line options and exit codes.
- Explore the Semgrep [Rules Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) to add rules to your project or [writing a rule](./writing-rules/overview.md).

## Testing Semgrep on vulnerable repositories

The following community projects are designed to test code scanners and teach security concepts. Try cloning and scanning them with Semgrep.

<details><summary>Expand for sample projects! ðŸŽ‰</summary>
<p>

```sh
# juice-shop, a vulnerable Node.js + Express app:
git clone https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop
cd juice-shop
semgrep --config=auto

# Or if you don't have Semgrep installed, replace the semgrep command with:
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/juice-shop:/src" returntocorp/semgrep semgrep --config p/security-audit /src

# Try railsgoat, a vulnerable Ruby on Rails app:
git clone https://github.com/OWASP/railsgoat
cd railsgoat
semgrep --config=auto

# govwa, a vulnerable Go app:
git clone https://github.com/0c34/govwa
cd govwa
semgrep --config=auto 

# Vulnerable-Flask-App, vulnerable Python + Flask:
git clone https://github.com/we45/Vulnerable-Flask-App
cd Vulnerable-Flask-App
semgrep --config=auto 

# WebGoat, a vulnerable Java + Spring app:
git clone https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat
cd WebGoat
semgrep --config=auto 
```

</p>

## Run Semgrep continuously

Semgrep is at its best when used to continuously scan code. Check out [Semgrep in CI](semgrep-ci/overview.md/) to learn how to get results where you already work: GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Jira, and more. To get results even earlier in the development process, such as in a Git pre-commit hook or VS Code, check the available [Semgrep extensions](./extensions.md).

Check out [Semgrep App](https://semgrep.dev/manage) to integrate CI with PR or MR comments, monitor progress, host private rules (paid tier), and much more! 

## Upgrading

We [release new Semgrep versions](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases) often! See [upgrading](./upgrading.md) for more details.
