# Compliance

Semgrep provides security tooling that can support compliance efforts, but does not guarantee compliance. Organizations remain responsible for meeting all compliance requirements. Consult with your compliance team and auditors to determine how Semgrep fits into your compliance program.

Semgrep can help address security requirements in the following compliance frameworks and standards:

### Government and federal standards

- **[FedRAMP](/docs/compliance/fedramp):** Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program for cloud services used by U.S. federal agencies
- **[NIST 800-171](/docs/compliance/nist-800-171):** Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in nonfederal systems

### Healthcare and privacy

- **[HIPAA/HITRUST](/docs/compliance/hipaa-hitrust):** Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and HITRUST Common Security Framework
- **[GDPR](/docs/compliance/gdpr):** General Data Protection Regulation for protecting personal data of EU residents

### Financial services

- **[PCI DSS](/docs/compliance/pci-dss):** Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard for protecting cardholder data

### Information security standards

- **[ISO 27001](/docs/compliance/iso27001):** International standard for information security management systems (ISMS)
- **[ISO 27017](/docs/compliance/iso-27017):** Code of practice for information security controls for cloud services

### SOC 2
