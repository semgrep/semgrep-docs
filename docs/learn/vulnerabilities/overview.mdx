# Understanding Security Vulnerabilities

Security vulnerabilities are weaknesses in software systems that can be exploited by attackers to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of applications and data. Understanding these vulnerabilities is crucial for building secure applications and maintaining a strong security posture.

## What We'll Teach You

This section covers common security vulnerabilities that affect modern applications. For each vulnerability type, you'll learn:

- **How the vulnerability occurs** - The root causes and common scenarios
- **Real-world examples** - Code patterns that introduce these issues  
- **Impact and risks** - What happens when these vulnerabilities are exploited
- **Prevention techniques** - Best practices to avoid these problems
- **Detection methods** - How Semgrep can help identify these issues in your code

Learning about these vulnerabilities helps you write more secure code and build better defenses into your applications from the start.
