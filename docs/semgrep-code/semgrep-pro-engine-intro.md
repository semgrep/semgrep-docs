### Enabling Semgrep Pro Engine in Semgrep Cloud Platform

:::info Prerequisite
- An existing Semgrep Cloud Platform account. See [Signing in to SCP](/semgrep-code/getting-started/#semgrep-code-with-semgrep-cloud-platform).
- [Team](https://semgrep.dev/pricing) tier or higher of Semgrep Code. If you want to try Semgrep Pro Engine, get in touch with us through our [contact page](https://semgrep.dev/contact-us).
:::

To enable Semgrep Pro Engine in the Semgrep Cloud Platform, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Semgrep Cloud Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
1. Select **[Settings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings)**.
1. Ensure that the <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-large-on"></i> **Pro Engine beta** toggle is enabled.
1. Ensure that you have the **default ruleset** added in your **[Rule Board](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/board)**. If this ruleset is **not** added, go to [https://semgrep.dev/p/default](https://semgrep.dev/p/default), and then click **Add to Rule Board**. For best results, place this ruleset in the Monitor column.
1. Optional: If you don't have any projects added to your organization, follow the procedures described in [Scanning a repository](/semgrep-code/getting-started/#semgrep-code-with-semgrep-cloud-platform) to scan a new project with Semgrep Pro Engine. Ensure that your project's language is supported by Semgrep Pro Engine.

:::info Testing Semgrep Pro Engine
To test Semgrep Pro Engine on a purposefully vulnerable repository, fork the [juice-shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) repository, and then add it to SCP by following the steps described in section [Adding or onboarding a new project (repository)](/semgrep-code/getting-started/#adding-or-onboarding-a-new-project-repository).

### Creating interfile analysis rules

Interfile analysis rules you use in Semgrep Pro Engine require the `interfile: true` key included under the rule `metadata` key. See the following [example](https://semgrep.dev/s/3NZb). This key signals Semgrep Pro Engine to use the rule for interfile analysis.

Example of `interfile: true` key:
```yaml
rules:
  - id: dangerous-call-to-employees-pro-engine-example
    metadata:
      interfile: true
    patterns:
      - pattern: dangerous("Employees")
    message: Call of dangerous on employees table
    languages:
      - js
    severity: WARNING
```

## Additional information

### Types of Semgrep Pro Engine analysis  

<dl>
    <dt>Interfile analysis</dt>
    <dd>The interfile analysis gathers context across multiple files to help security engineers deeply understand their organization's security issues. Semgrep Pro Engine reduces noise and detects new vulnerabilities that Semgrep OSS Engine can't find. Interfile analysis runs on nightly scans. These scans may take longer to complete and can use more memory than Semgrep OSS Engine scans. See the available languages for interfile analysis in <a href="/docs/supported-languages/#semgrep-pro-engine">Semgrep Pro Engine supported languages</a>.</dd>
    <dt>Interprocedural analysis</dt>
    <dd>Interprocedural analysis keeps the fast scan times of Semgrep OSS Engine while also finding new vulnerabilities that cross functions within a single file. Interprocedural analysis improves results in pull requests (PRs) or merge requests (MRs) through CI scans. The interprocedural analysis is available for all languages listed as GA on the <a href="/docs/supported-languages/">Supported languages</a> page</dd>
</dl>

### Semgrep Pro Engine CI scans

By default, when you use Semgrep Pro Engine in CI:

- PR and MR scans (triggered by opening a new PR or MR, or when a new changes are introduced to a PR or MR) use interprocedural analysis, limited to single files. This is a fast scan, that crosses the boundaries of individual functions in each file.
- Full scans, also called scheduled cron job or nightly scans use interfile and interprocedural analysis. This type of scan finds complex vulnerabilities that cross the boundaries of single files and functions, providing security teams with deeper analysis. This type of scan also requires more time. 

#### Semgrep Pro Engine CI scan issues

To provide reliably completed scans, Semgrep Pro Engine can fall back to the use of Semgrep OSS Engine. This ensures that in the vast majority of cases, scans run successfully.

If a scan uses more than 5&nbsp;GB of memory during pre-processing, the scan uses Semgrep OSS Engine to ensure lower memory consumption. Similarly, if the Semgrep Pro Engine scan doesn't complete after 3 hours, the Pro Engine times out and Semgrep OSS rescans the repository. Typically, this is because the repository is very large.

If 1-2 repositories cause CI scan issues, modify your config file to use `semgrep ci --oss-only`. This overrides the Semgrep CI settings for these repositories, and always runs these scans with Semgrep OSS. 

If many repositories cause scan issues:
1. Disable the <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-large-on"></i> **Pro Engine beta** toggle in the **[Settings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings)** page of your organization.
1. Contact the Semgrep team in the <a href="https://go.semgrep.dev/slack">Semgrep Community Slack</a> so we can help you to fix the issue and create a plan for your organization.

### Difference between Semgrep Pro Engine and join mode

Semgrep Pro Engine is different from [join mode](/writing-rules/experiments/join-mode/overview/), which also allows you to perform interfile analyses by letting you join on the metavariable matches in separate rules. Join mode is an experimental feature which is not actively developed or maintained. You may encounter many issues while using join mode.

### Feedback for Semgrep Pro Engine

The team at Semgrep is excited to hear whatâ€™s on your mind. As you explore Semgrep Pro Engine, we want to know what you'd like to be able to capture with it. We believe that this deeper analysis helps users find more vulnerabilities, build trust with developers, and enforce code standards quickly. Let us know what you think about the results in the <a href="https://go.semgrep.dev/slack">Semgrep Community Slack</a>.
