Semgrep Code is a static application security testing (SAST) tool that detects security vulnerabilities in your first-party code.

You can use Semgrep Code to scan local repositories or integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the continuous scanning of your code.

## Rules

<SemgrepScan />

In addition to rules available in the [Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r), you can write custom rules to determine what Semgrep Code detects in your repositories. Whether you use pre-existing rules or write custom rules, knowing *which* rules Semgrep Code runs can help you understand how it detects security issues.

Semgrep Code is transparent; you can configure the rules it runs and inspect its syntax to understand how the finding was detected. You can also customize the content of a rule to improve the true positive rate of a rule or have Semgrep send a relevant message to developers.

## Findings

Semgrep Cloud Platform (SCP) displays Semgrep Code's findings. Additionally, SCP allows you to:

* Triage findings
* Send alerts and notifications or create tickets to track findings identified by Semgrep Code
* Customize how Semgrep Code scans your repositories
* Manage your users and facilitate team collaboration in remediating security issues

## OSS versus Pro Engine

By default, Semgrep Code is powered by Semgrep's OSS engine. It can analyze interactions within a single function, a process known as intraprocedural analysis, and its smaller scope of analysis makes it faster and easier to integrate into developer workflows.

For cross-file and cross-function analysis (interfile and interprocedural analysis, respectively), you can enable [Semgrep's Pro Engine](/semgrep-code/semgrep-pro-engine-intro/). These scans produce fewer false positives and more true positives, but take longer to complete.
