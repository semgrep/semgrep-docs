# Semantic detection in Java

This document explains how Semgrep detects true positives and reduces false positives in Java.

Additionally, it provides several simple rule examples to illustrate the concepts and how you can make use of these Semgrep features when writing your own rules.

The code examples shown here are best viewed in **a separate Semgrep Playground tab** so that you can see the <span style={{backgroundColor: '#b968ff'}}><i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i></span> purple star outline. This star marks the lines that contain false positives and are correctly identified and removed by Semgrep.

## Language features that prevent injection through Boolean and integer types

Strong typing in Java, combined with its compile-time and runtime checks, reduces the likelihood that an integer or Boolean input will be exploited to perform injection-style attacks. Semgrep Pro can reduce false positives by leveraging these checks.

The Semgrep OSS Engine matches based on patterns, which can result in false positives (FPs), but only proprietary Semgrep can detect Boolean and integer values and mark these as untainted, or safe, eliminating FPs.

### Example: `int-bool-untainted`

The following demo rule and code sample detects tainted data in `sink()`.

```yaml showLineNumbers
# Semgrep rule
rules:
  - id: int-bool-untainted
    languages:
      - java
    severity: WARNING
    options:
      interfile: true
      taint_assume_safe_booleans: true
      taint_assume_safe_numbers: true
    mode: taint
    message: Test
    pattern-sources:
      - patterns:
          - pattern-inside: |
              class $C {
                $T $M(..., $A, ...) {
                  ...
                }
              }
          - focus-metavariable: $A
    pattern-sinks:
      - pattern: sink(...)
```

```java showLineNumbers
class Foo {
  String x;
  List<Integer> ids;

  public List<Integer> getIds() {
    return ids;
  }
}

class Bar {
  String y;
  Set<Boolean> flags;

  public Set<Boolean> getFlags() {
    return flags;
  }
}

class Test {
  public void test1(Foo foo) {
      //ruleid: int-bool-untainted
      //highlight-next-line
      sink(foo.x);
      //OK: int-bool-untainted
☆     sink(foo.getIds().get(0));
  }
  public void test2(Bar bar) {
      //ruleid: int-bool-untainted
      //highlight-next-line
      sink(bar.y);
      //OK: int-bool-untainted
☆     sink(bar.getFlags().get(0));
  }
}
```

* This example has two true positives: **line 22** and **line 28**.
* Semgrep Pro is able to detect that **line 24 and 30 are false positives**. Semgrep OSS can't catch that distinction.
    * Line 24 is a false positive because the data in the sink is an element of an integer list.
    * Line 30 is a false positive because the data in the sink is an element in a set of Boolean values.
* The Semgrep rule uses the fields `taint_assume_safe_booleans` and `taint_assume_safe_numbers` to tell the engine that these types are safe and not tainted.

## Semgrep understands the Java standard library and APIs

Java provides a wide array of standard classes and methods across its various libraries. These facilitate programming by offering ready-to-use methods for common tasks. Many of these take string inputs, and return integer or Boolean values. Thus, these statements returning integer or Boolean values are not considered tainted. Semgrep is able to make that distinction, preventing this type of false positive.

### Example: `sqli-demo-bool_doesnt_taint`

<!-- <iframe title="sqli-demo-bool_doesnt_taint" src="https://semgrep.dev/embed/editor?snippet=Kx1AY" width="100%" height="432px" frameBorder="0"></iframe> -->

This demo rule detects SQL injection through a `UserInputGenerator` class. The class's unsanitized user input is passed to `SQLQueryRunner`.

```yaml showLineNumbers
# Semgrep rule
rules:
  - id: sqli-demo-bool_doesnt_taint
    message: Found SQLi
    languages:
      - java
    severity: WARNING
    mode: taint
    options:
      taint_assume_safe_booleans: true
      taint_assume_safe_numbers: true
      interfile: true
    pattern-sources:
      - pattern: |
          (UserInputGenerator $X).getUserInput(...)
    pattern-sinks:
      - pattern: |
          (SQLQueryRunner $X).run(...)
```

```java showLineNumbers
public class Test {
  // Run with `javac Test.java && java Test`
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SQLQueryRunner runner = new SQLQueryRunner();
    String input = new UserInputGenerator().getUserInput();

    // safe
    runner.run("SELECT * from table");

    //ruleid:sqli-demo-bool_dont_taint
    //highlight-next-line
    runner.run("SELECT * from " + input);

    //ok:sqli-demo-bool_dont_taint
☆   runner.run("SELECT * from table" + input.endsWith("something"));

    //ok:sqli-demo-bool_dont_taint
☆   runner.run("SELECT * from table" + input.indexOf('u'));

    //ruleid:sqli-demo-bool_dont_taint
    //highlight-next-line
    runner.run("SELECT * from " + input.substring(0));
  }
}

class UserInputGenerator {
  public String getUserInput() {
    return "fake user input";
  }
}

class SQLQueryRunner {
  public void run(String query) {
    System.out.println("Would have run query:");
    System.out.println(query);
  }
}
```

* This example has two true positives: **line 11** and **line 20**.
* Semgrep Pro is able to detect that **line 14 and 17 are false positives**. Semgrep OSS can't catch that distinction.
    * Lines 14 and 17 are false positives because `input.endsWith("something")` and `input.indexOf('u')` return a Boolean and integer respectively. Semgrep Pro is able to understand `endsWith` and `indexOf` Java methods.
* The Semgrep rule uses the fields `taint_assume_safe_booleans` and `taint_assume_safe_numbers` to tell the engine that these types are safe and not tainted.

## Semgrep targets code in a parent class and its subclasses

Semgrep supports class inheritance in Java. You can use Semgrep to search across all subclasses. This specificity means that rules can better target your codebase, increasing true positive rates. This is achieved through the `metavariable-type` field, which can accept the name of any user-defined class.

The `metavariable-type` field is available in Semgrep OSS. However, classes in Java are frequently defined across files (interfile), which is beyond the scope of Semgrep OSS's analysis. Use Semgrep Pro to perform cross-file analysis to ensure that Semgrep can detect all class and subclass definitions.

### Example: `detect-pattern-in-subclass`

<!-- <iframe title="detect-pattern-in-subclass" src="https://semgrep.dev/embed/editor?snippet=nJjjG" width="100%" height="432px" frameBorder="0"></iframe> -->

```yaml showLineNumbers
# Semgrep rule
rules:
  - id: detect-pattern-in-subclass
    languages:
      - java
    message: Test
    options:
      interfile: true
    patterns:
      - pattern: $CLASS.x
      - metavariable-type:
          metavariable: $CLASS
          type: Foo
    severity: WARNING
```

```java showLineNumbers
class Foo { String x; }

class Bar extends Foo {}

class Baz { String x; }

class Test {
    void test() {
        Bar bar = new Bar();
        //ruleid:detect-pattern-in-subclass
        //highlight-next-line
        return bar.x;
    }
}

class Test2 {
    void test() {
        Baz baz = new Baz();
☆       return baz.x;
    }
}

class Test3 {
    void test() {
        Foo foo = new Foo();
        //ruleid:detect-pattern-in-subclass
        //highlight-next-line
        return foo.x;
    }
}
```

**Figure**. `detect-pattern-in-subclass`. [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Open in  interactive Playground](https://semgrep.dev/playground/s/nJjjG).

This demo rule detects patterns in instances of the user-defined parent class `Foo` and its subclasses.

- This example has two true positives: **line 10** and **line 24**.
- The `patterns` array initially defines a `pattern: $CLASS.x`.
    - **Line 17**, `baz.x` fulfills this pattern.
    - However, the `metavariable-type` specifies a `type` of `Foo`.
    - This specification narrows the match to **line 10** because `Bar` is a subclass of `Foo`, and **line 25**, which is an instance of the `Foo` object itself.

## Semgrep supports field and index sensitivity

Field sensitivity means that Semgrep can track taint for each field of an object independently. Given an object `C` with properties `C.x` and `C.y`, if `C.x` is tainted, then Semgrep does **not** automatically mark `C.y` as tainted.

Similarly, index sensitivity means that Semgrep can track taint for each element of an array independently.

### Example: `unsafe-sql-concatenation-in-method-taint-field-sensitivity`

<!-- <iframe title="unsafe-sql-concatenation-in-method-taint-field-sensitivity" src="https://semgrep.dev/embed/editor?snippet=OrAwe" width="100%" height="432px" frameBorder="0"></iframe> -->

This demo rule detects that `C.x` is tainted by way of the `injection` variable. It is able to differentiate `C.y` as untainted.

```yaml showLineNumbers
# Semgrep rule
rules:
  - id: unsafe-sql-concatenation-in-method-taint-field-sensitivity
    languages:
      - java
    severity: WARNING
    metadata:
      interfile: true
    mode: taint
    message: Test
    options:
      taint_assume_safe_booleans: true
      taint_assume_safe_numbers: true
      interfile: true
    pattern-sources:
      - patterns:
          - pattern: |
              $X(..., $SRC, ...) { ... }
          - focus-metavariable: $SRC
    pattern-sinks:
      - patterns:
          - pattern-either:
              - pattern: com.netsuite.database.SqlLogger.execute(..., $SINK)
              - pattern: com.netsuite.database.Util.execute(..., $SINK)
    pattern-sanitizers:
      - pattern: com.netsuite.database.Util.generateSubSqlForBinding(...)
      - pattern: com.netsuite.database.Util.generateSubSql(...)
```

```Java showLineNumbers
import com.netsuite.database.SqlLogger;
import com.netsuite.database.Util;
import com.netsuite.database.SqlBuilder;

import java.sql.SQLException;

class C {
  String x;
  String y;

  C(String x, String y) {
    this.x = x;
    this y = y;
  }
}

class Test {
    private void LoggerTruePositives(String injection) {
        String stm = "This should not be a String. It is just to simplify the testing process";

        C c = new C(injection, "safe");

        //ruleid:unsafe-sql-concatenation-in-method-taint-field-sensitivity
        //highlight-next-line
        String tp1_1 = SqlLogger.execute(stm,"SELECT c1, c2 from tablename where c1 = " + c.getX());

        //ok:unsafe-sql-concatenation-in-method-taint-field-sensitivity
☆       String tp1_2 = SqlLogger.execute(stm,"SELECT c1, c2 from tablename where c1 = " + c.getY());
}
```

**Figure**. `unsafe-sql-concatenation-in-method-taint-field-sensitivity`. [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Open in interactive Playground](https://semgrep.dev/playground/s/OrAwe).

- This example has one true positive on **line 24** and one true negative on **line 27**.
- **Line 17** of the rule tells Semgrep to match for the following pattern:
  ```yaml
  pattern: |
    $X(..., $SRC, ...) { ... }
    focus-metavariable: $SRC
  ```
  - This matches `private void LoggerTruePositives(String injection)`, specifically the `injection` variable in the sample code.
- The value of the injection variable is passed to `C.x`, thus, `C.x` is tainted, but `C.y` is not.
