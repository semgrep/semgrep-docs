# Policies

Increase the breadth and depth of your scan coverage or remove noise from scans through the Policies page. Block or allow merges for pull requests (PRs) or merge requests (MRs) based on the rule that detected the finding.

The Policies page displays a visual representation of the rules that Semgrep Code uses for scanning. By default, the same rules in Policies are applied to all repositories.

To learn more about rules, see [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Running rules](/running-rules/).

:::info Speed and language coverage
Semgrep Code identifies the languages used in your repositories and **only runs rules applicable to those languages**.

For example, adding Ruby and Python rules in your Policies **does not affect the scan speed** for Python-only repositories. Only Python rules are run for Python repositories.

## Policies page structure

![Default view of the Policies page](/img/policies.png)
_**Figure.**_ Default view of the Policies page, known as the **Group by vulnerability class** view.

The Policies page consists of a header and three main panes:

<dl>
    <dt>Policies header</dt>
        <dd>
            The top header consists of:
            <ul>
             <li><strong>Policies view drop-down</strong>, which lets you choose between: 
                <ul><li>Grouping rules by vulnerability class</li>
                <li>No grouping</li>
                </ul></li>
                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> <b>Rule Modes</b> button where you can view <strong>rule modes</strong> and edit <strong>notifications</strong> for each rule mode. Rule modes define what <strong>workflow actions</strong> Semgrep Code performs when a rule detects a finding. For example, setting a rule's mode to <strong>Comment</strong> means that Semgrep posts PR or MR comments from findings generated by that rule. See <a href="#blocking-a-pr-or-mr-through-rule-modes">Blocking a PR or MR through rule modes</a> for more information.</li>
                <li><strong>Add rules</strong> button that takes you to the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/explore"><i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Semgrep Registry</a> where you can add rules to the Policies page and assign their initial modes.</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
    <dt>Filter pane</dt>
        <dd>
           Displays filters to quickly select and perform operations on rules in bulk. See <a href="#policies-filter-reference">Policies filter reference</a> for more information.
        </dd>
    <dt>Rule pane</dt>
        <dd>
            The rule pane displays the rules that Semgrep scans use to detect findings and allows you to edit their assigned rule modes. You can make these edits either one by one or through bulk editing of many rules. You can also use the <strong>Search for rule names or ids</strong> box. See <a href="#policies-filter-reference">Policies filter reference</a> for more information.
        </dd>
</dl>

## Blocking a PR or MR through rule modes

Semgrep enables you to set a **workflow action** based on the presence of a finding. Workflow actions include:

* Failing a CI job, resulting in blocking a PR or MR.
* Leaving a PR or MR comment.
* Notifying select channels, such as private Slack channels or webhooks.

Semgrep Code provides three rule modes:

| Rule mode | Description |
| -------   | ------ |
| Monitor   | Rules in **Monitor mode** display findings only in: <ul><li>Semgrep Cloud Platform</li><li>User-defined notifications</li></ul>Set rules to this mode to evaluate their true positive rate and other criteria you may have. By keeping rules in Monitor, developers do not receive potentially noisy findings in their PRs or MRs.  |
| Comment   | Rules in **Comment mode** display findings in:<ul><li>Developers' PRs or MRs</li><li>Semgrep Cloud Platform</li><li>User-defined notifications</li></ul>Set rules that have met your performance criteria to this mode when you are ready to display findings to developers.     |
| Block     | Rules in **Block mode** prevent a PR or MR from merging if Semgrep Code detects a finding from these rules.<br />These rules display findings in:<ul><li>Developers' PRs or MRs</li><li>Semgrep Cloud Platform</li><li>User-defined notifications</li></ul>These are typically high-confidence, high-severity rules. |

Semgrep Code provides first-time users with the [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Default ruleset](https://semgrep.dev/p/default). These rules are initially placed in the Monitor column. As you develop confidence in these rules, you are able to change their modes to Comment or Block, ensuring that developers remain free of friction from false positives.

## Adding rules

To add rules, follow these steps:

1. On the [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Policies](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/policies) page, click **Add Rules**.
1. You are redirected to the [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) page. Explore the page, open cards of individual rules, and then click **Add to Policy**.
1. Specify the workflow action of the rule that you are adding. Select either: 
    - Monitor
    - Comment
    - Block

### Adding custom rules to your Policies

To add custom rules, use the Semgrep Editor. See [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Setting code standards with the Policies page](/semgrep-code/editor/#setting-code-standards-with-the-policies-page).

## Disabling rules

To disable a rule, follow these steps:

1. On the **Policies** page, select either:
    - The top **<span className="placeholder">Number</span> Matching Rules** checkbox to select all rules.
    - Select individual checkboxes next to a rule to disable rules one by one.
1. Click **(<span className="placeholder">Number</span>) Edit**, and then click **Disabled**.

You can also select individual rules under the **Mode** column and disable them one by one.

## Policies filter reference

This section defines the Policies page filters:

| Filter | Description | Examples or possible values |
| -------  | ------ | ------ |
| Modes  | Filter by the workflow action Semgrep performs when a rule detects a finding. An additional filter, **Disabled**, is provided for rules that you have turned off and are no longer included for scanning.  | See [Rule modes](#blocking-a-pr-or-mr-through-rule-modes) documentation.  |
| Category  | Filter by the type of security issue or vulnerability that the rule detects.  | <ul><li>Dangerous method or function</li><li>SQL injection</li><li>Active debug code</li></ul> |

## Multiple policies

:::info Multiple policies feature (private beta)
If you have the **multiple policies** feature, you can customize the rules that run on specific repositories. Currently, this beta is not accepting new participants.
:::

The multiple policies feature enables users to customize the rules that run on specific repositories. 

Users create different policies that repositories can **subscribe** to.

This feature makes use of a **Global Policy** that runs on **all** repositories. Repositories cannot unsubscribe from it.

You can create a policy, for example, "Custom Coding Standards Policy", with some additional rules, and add it to one or more repositories. During a scan, these repositories run all of the rules from the **Global Policy** as well as all the rules from your "Custom Coding Standards Policy".

### Resolving workflow actions in multiple policies

If a rule is in multiple policies, then the rule is deduplicated and Semgrep prioritizes the workflow action based on the rule's mode where precedence is as follows: 

1. Block
2. Comment
3. Monitor

For example, if an instance of `Rule A` is set to **Block**, then the scan blocks PRs for any findings from that rule, even if the same `Rule A` is set to **Monitor** in another policy applied to that repository.
