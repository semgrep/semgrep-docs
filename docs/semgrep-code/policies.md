# Policies

Increase the breadth and depth of your scan coverage or remove noise from scans through the Policies page. The Policies page displays a visual representation of the rules that Semgrep Code uses for scanning. By default, the same rules in Policies are applied to all repositories.

To learn more about rules, see [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Running rules](/running-rules/).

:::info Speed and language coverage
Semgrep Code identifies the languages used in your repositories and **only runs rules applicable to those languages**.

For example, adding Ruby and Python rules in your Policies **does not affect the scan speed** for Python-only repositories. Only Python rules are run for Python repositories.

## Policies page structure

![Default view of the Policies page](/img/policies.png)
_**Figure.**_ Default view of the Policies page, known as the **Group by vulnerability class** view.

The Policies page consists of a header and three main panes:

<dl>
    <dt>Policies header</dt>
        <dd>
            The top header consists of:
            <ul>
             <li><strong>Policies view drop-down</strong>, which lets you choose between: 
                <ul><li>Grouping rules by vulnerability</li>
                <li>No grouping</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> <b>Rule Modes</b> button where you can view <strong>rule modes</strong> and edit <strong>notifications</strong> for each rule mode. Rule modes define continuous integration (CI) workflow actions that occur when a rule detects a finding. For example, setting a rule's mode to <strong>Comment</strong> means that findings generated by that rule are posted as PR or MR comments in your source code manager. See todo for more information</li>
                <li><b>Add rules</b> button that takes you to the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/explore">Semgrep Registry</a> where you can add rules to the Policies page and assign their initial modes.</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
    <dt>Filter pane</dt>
        <dd>
           Displays filters to quickly select and perform operations on rules in bulk. See todo for more information.
        </dd>
    <dt>Rule pane</dt>
        <dd>
            The rule pane displays the rules that Semgrep scans use to detect findings and allows you to edit their assigned rule modes. You can make these edits either one by one or through bulk editing of many rules. You can also use the <strong>Search for rule names or ids</strong> box. See <a href="#rule-pane-in-detail">Rule pane in detail</a> for more information.
        </dd>
</dl>

### Rule pane in detail

This section explains columns in the rule pane of the Policies page in detail:

- **Rule name**: Name of the rule that Semgrep Code uses for scanning.
- **Severity**: The higher the severity, the more critical the issues are that a rule detects. The Policies page displays the **high**, **medium**, and **low** severities.
- **Confidence**: Indicates confidence of the rule to detect true positives. There are rules with **high**, **medium**, and **low** confidence.
- **Source**: Indicates whether the rule is a **Pro**, **Community rule**, or a **Custom rule** .
    - **Pro**: Authored by Semgrep with cross-file (interfile), and cross-function (interprocedural) analysis capabilities providing you with enhanced scan accuracy. For more information, see [Pro rules](/semgrep-code/pro-rules/) documentation.
    - **Community**: Authored by Semgrep, Inc or external contributors such as Trail of Bits.
    - **Custom**: Rules created within your Semgrep organization. For more information, see [Private rules](/writing-rules/private-rules/) documentation.
- **Ruleset**: Rules are also organized in rulesets. Rulesets are groups of rules related through a programming language, OWASP category, or framework.
- **Mode**: Specifies what happens when a rule detects a finding (sometimes called matching - when a rule matches a code). The mode indicates how the findings for each rule are reported to you and your developers. There are the three following modes:
    - **Monitor**: Display findings only on the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page of Semgrep Code.
    - **Comment**: Display findings on the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page of Semgrep Code and create comments in merge requests (MR) or pull requests (PR).
    - **Block**: Display findings on the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page of Semgrep Code, create comments in MR and PR, and fail the build to block merging where the finding was detected.
    - **Disabled**: Disabled rules do not scan your code or detect findings. This is helpful if rules are too noisy and detect many false positives that you otherwise need to ignore manually.

:::tip
To change assigned modes, select either the top **Matching Rules** checkbox to select all rules, or select individual checkboxes next to a rule, and then click **(<span className="placeholder">Number</span>) Edit** or click individual rules in the **Mode** column.
:::

:::info
All of these columns correspond to the filters in the filter pane.
:::

## Adding rules

To add rules, follow these steps:

1. On the [Policies](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/policies) page, click **Add Rules**.
1. You are redirected to the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) page. Explore the page, open cards of individual rules, and then click **Add to Policy**.
1. Specify the behavior of the rule that you are adding. Select either: 
    - **Monitor**: Display findings only on the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page of Semgrep Code.
    - **Comment**: Display findings on the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page of Semgrep Code and create comments in MRs or PRs.
    - **Block**: Display findings on the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page of Semgrep Code, create comments in MRs or PRs, and block PRs or MRs where the finding was detected.

### Adding custom rules

To add custom rules from the Semgrep Editor, see [Editor: Setting code standards with the Policies page](docs/semgrep-code/editor/#setting-code-standards-with-the-policies-page).

## Disabling rules

To disable a rule, follow these steps:

1. On the **Policies** page, select either:
    - The top **<span className="placeholder">Number</span> Matching Rules** checkbox to select all rules.
    - Select individual checkboxes next to a rule to disable rules one by one.
1. Click **(<span className="placeholder">Number</span>) Edit**, and then click **Disabled**.

You can also select individual rules under the **Mode** column and disable them one by one.

## Multiple policies

:::info Multiple policies feature (private beta)
If you have the **multiple policies** feature, you can customize the rules that run on specific repositories. Currently, this beta is not accepting new participants.
:::

The multiple policies feature enables users to customize the rules that run on specific repositories. 

Users create different policies that repositories can **subscribe** to.

This feature makes use of a **Global Policy** that runs on **all** repositories. Repositories cannot unsubscribe from it.

You can create a policy, such **Custom Coding Standards Policy**, with some additional rules, and add it to one or more repositories. During a scan, these repositories run all of the rules from the **Global Policy** as well as all the rules from **Custom Coding Standards Policy**.

### Resolving workflow actions in multiple policies

If a rule is in multiple policies, then the rule is deduplicated and Semgrep prioritizes the workflow action based on the rule's mode where precedence is as follows: 

1. Block
2. Comment
3. Monitor

For example, if an instance of `Rule A` is set to **Block**, then the scan blocks PRs for any findings from that rule, even if the same `Rule A` is set to **Monitor** in another policy applied to that repository.


                Modes define actions that occur when a rule detects a finding. The modes that you can edit are Monitor, Comment, Block. When you click the Rule Modes button, and then click <b>Edit</b> button of a mode, you can add integrations such as <a href="/semgrep-cloud-platform/email-notifications/">Email</a>, <a href="/semgrep-cloud-platform/slack-notifications/">Slack</a>, and <a href="/semgrep-cloud-platform/webhooks/">Webhook</a> for each of the modes. When an integration has been added to a mode, you are notified through the integration when a rule with the assigned mode detects a finding.
