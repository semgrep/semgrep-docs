# Policies

:::tip
The Policies page is a new version of the [Rule board](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/board).

To access the Policies page: Go to [Rule board](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/board), and then click **Try new version**. You can always go back to the old Rule board by clicking the **Back to old version** button.

The Policies page displays a visual representation of the rules that Semgrep Code uses for scanning. Rules can be categorized into various groups. The Policies page uses the following categorization criteria:

## Policies page structure

![Screenshot of the default state of the Policies page](/img/policies.png)

The Policies page consists of a header and two main panes:

<dl>
    <dt>Policies header</dt>
        <dd>
            The top header consists of:
            <ul>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> <b>Rule Modes</b> button where you can specify integrations for each of the rule modes. Modes are actions that rules perform when they detect a finding. These modes are Monitor, Comment, Block, and Disabled. These integrations include <a href="/semgrep-cloud-platform/email-notifications/">Email</a>, <a href="/semgrep-cloud-platform/slack-notifications/">Slack</a>, and <a href="/semgrep-cloud-platform/webhooks/">Webhook</a> for each mode.</li>
                <li><b>Add rules</b> button that takes you to the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/explore">Semgrep Registry</a> where you can add rules to the Policies page and assign their initial modes.</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
    <dt>Filter pane</dt>
        <dd>
            Left pane where you can use the following filters to display specific rules:
            <ul>
                <li>Category</li>
                <li>Mode</li>
                <li>Confidence</li>
                <li>Severities</li>
                <li>Source</li>
                <li>Ruleset</li>
                <li>Language</li>
            </ul>
            These filters are explained further below as they correspond to the Rule pane columns also.
        </dd>
    <dt>Rule pane</dt>
        <dd>
            The right pane displays a number of rules with the <b>Matching Rules</b> title. This pane visualizes the rules that are used in your Semgrep Cloud Platform organization and allows you to edit their assigned modes (Monitor, Comment, Block, and Disabled). You can make these edits either one by one or through bulk editing of many rules. You can also use the <b>Search for rule names or ids</b> search box. The individual columns are explained separately below in the <a href="#rule-pane-in-detail">Rule pane in detail</a> section.
        </dd>
</dl>

### Rule pane in detail

This section explains columns in the rule pane of the Policies page in detail:

- **Rule name**: Name of the rule that Semgrep Code uses for scanning.
- **Severity**: The higher the severity, the more critical the issues are that a rule detects. The Policies page displays the **high**, **medium**, and **low** severities.
- **Confidence**: Indicates confidence of the rule to detect true positives. There are rules with **high**, **medium**, and **low** confidence.
- **Source**: Indicates whether the rule is a **Pro**, **Community rule**, or a **Custom rule** .
    - **Pro**: Authored by Semgrep with cross-file (interfile), and cross-function (interprocedural) analysis capabilities providing you with enhanced scan accuracy. For more information, see [Pro rules](/semgrep-code/pro-rules/) documentation.
    - **Community**: Authored by Semgrep, Inc or external contributors such as Trail of Bits.
    - **Custom**: Rules created within your Semgrep organization. For more information, see [Private rules](/writing-rules/private-rules/) documentation.
- **Ruleset**: Rules are also organized in rulesets. Rulesets are groups of rules related through a programming language, OWASP category, or framework.
- **Mode**: Specifies what happens when a rule detects a finding (sometimes called matching - when a rule matches a code). The mode indicates how the findings for each rule are reported to you and your developers. There are the three following modes:
    - **Monitor**: Display findings only on the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page of Semgrep Code.
    - **Comment**: Display findings on the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page of Semgrep Code and create comments in merge requests (MR) or pull requests (PR).
    - **Block**: Display findings on the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page of Semgrep Code, create comments in MR and PR, and fail the build to block merging where the finding was detected.
    - **Disabled**: Disabled rules do not scan your code or detect findings. This is helpful if rules are too noisy and detect many false positives that you otherwise need to ignore manually.

:::tip
To change assigned modes, select either the top **Matching Rules** checkbox to select all rules, or select individual checkboxes next to a rule, and then click **(<span className="placeholder">Number</span>) Edit** or click individual rules in the **Mode** column.
:::

:::info
All of these columns correspond to the filters in the filter pane.

## Adding rules

To add rules, follow these steps:

1. On the [Policies](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/board) page, click **Add Rules**.
1. You are redirected to the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) page. Explore the page, open cards of individual rules, and then click **Add to Rule Board**.
1. Specify the behavior of the rule that you are adding. Select either: 
    - **Monitor**: Display findings only on the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page of Semgrep Code.
    - **Comment**: Display findings on the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page of Semgrep Code and create comments in MRs or PRs.
    - **Block**: Display findings on the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page of Semgrep Code, create comments in MRs or PRs, and block PRs or MRs where the finding was detected.

## Disabling rules

To disable a rule, follow these steps:

1. On the **Policies** page, select either:
    - The top **<span className="placeholder">Number</span> Matching Rules** checkbox to select all rules.
    - Select individual checkboxes next to a rule to disable rules one by one.
1. Click **(<span className="placeholder">Number</span>) Edit**, and then click **Disabled**.

You can also select individual rules under the **Mode** column and disable them one by one.
