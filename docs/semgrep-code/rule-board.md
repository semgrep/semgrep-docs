# Rule board

The Rule Board is a visual representation of the rules that Semgrep Code uses for scanning. Rules can be organized in rulesets. Rulesets are rules related through a programming language, OWASP category, or framework.

Rules and rulesets are displayed as **cards** in Semgrep Cloud Platform. Group cards by dragging and dropping cards into the columns. Columns represent the actions undertaken in response to findings from that rule or ruleset.

The columns and their corresonding actions are:

<dl>
    <dt>Monitor</dt>
    <dd>Rules that display findings only in Semgrep Cloud Platform.</dd>
    <dt>Comment</dt>
    <dd>Rules that display findings to developers through PR or MRs.</dd>
    <dt>Block</dt>
    <dd>Rules that block merges and commits, in addition to showing findings in Semgrep Cloud Platform and PRs or MRs.</dd>
</dl>

Semgrep Code is pre-configured to use the `default` ruleset. The `default` ruleset scans for security vulnerabilities in common programming languages and frameworks.

Semgrep Code detects the framework and language when scanning a project and only runs rules relevant for that framework and language.

## Adding rules or rulesets

### Through the search bar

1. Click **Add rules**. A drawer appears.
2. Search for rules by entering a relevant search term, such as your programming language, OWASP category, or framework in the search bar.
3. Optional: Display the rules within a ruleset by clicking on the **Expand** icon beside the name of the ruleset.
4. Optional: Display the rule definition by clicking on the **View in Playground** icon beside the name of the rule.
5. Drag the card and drop it on the relevant column.
6. Once you are done adding rules and rulesets, click **Save changes**.

### From Semgrep Registry

1. Click a rule or ruleset in [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r/).
2. Click **Add these to Rule Board** or **Add to Rule Board**.
