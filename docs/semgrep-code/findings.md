# View findings in Semgrep AppSec Platform

Semgrep Code generates a **finding** when a rule matches a piece of code in your codebase. You can use Semgrep AppSec Platform's [**Code** page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings) to view all of the findings generated by Semgrep Code after it scans your codebase.

![Semgrep AppSec Platform Code page](/img/app-findings-overview.png)

## Navigate to the Code page

To access the [**Code** page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings):

1. Log in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Click **[Code](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings)**.

## Code page structure

The **Code** page consists of:

- The **filter panel**, which you can use to group and filter for specific findings
- Information about findings identified by Semgrep Code. Each finding in the list includes:
  - The name and description of the rule used to generate the finding
  - The name of the project
  - A link to the commit where the finding was first identified
  - A link to the lines of code where the finding was most recently seen

### Group findings

By default, Semgrep groups all of the findings by the rule Semgrep used to match the code. This view is called the **Group by rule** view.

Semgrep sorts findings by severity. For a given severity, Semgrep further sorts findings as follows:

1. Findings generated by custom rules
2. Findings generated by [Pro rules](/semgrep-code/pro-rules)
3. Issue count in descending order
4. Findings ID in ascending order

![Findings grouped by rule](/img/app-findings.png#md-width)

To view findings individually, toggle **Group by Rule** to **No grouping** using the drop-down menu in the header. Findings are displayed based on the date they were found, with the most recent finding listed at the top.

### Default Code page view

### Filter findings

Use filters to narrow down your results. The following criteria are available for filtering:

| Filter                 | Description  |
| ---------------------  | ------------ |
| **Projects**           | Filter by repositories connected to Semgrep AppSec Platform. |
| **Branches**           | Filter by findings in different Git branches. |
| **Teams**              | Filter for findings in projects to which the specified teams are associated with. Available only to organizations with RBAC enabled. |
| **Tags**               | Filter for findings based on the tags associated with the project. |
| **Status**             | Filter the triage state of a finding. Refer to [Triage statuses](/semgrep-code/triage-remediation#triage-statuses) to understand triage states. You can filter findings with a status of **Ignored** further by reason: **False positive**, **Acceptable risk**, **No time to fix**, or **No triage reason**. |
| **Severity**           | Filter by the severity of a finding. Severity is computed based on the values assigned for [Likelihood](/contributing/contributing-to-semgrep-rules-repository/#likelihood) and [Impact](/contributing/contributing-to-semgrep-rules-repository/#impact) by the rule's author. Possible values: <ul><li>Low</li><li>Medium</li><li>High</li></ul> |
| **Confidence**         | Filter by the likelihood of the rule to detect true positives. The higher the confidence, the more true positives the rule may detect. |
| **Pro findings**       | Filter for findings identified using Semgrep Pro rules. Also includes findings originating from cross-file or cross-function analysis. |
| **Category**           | Filter by the type of security issue or vulnerability the rule detects, such as `security`, `correctness`, and `maintainability`. You can select more than one category at a time. See [Finding categories](#finding-categories) for information on how Semgrep categorizes your findings. |
| **Component**          | Filter by [Semgrep Assistant component tags](/semgrep-assistant/overview#component-tags). Semgrep Assistant uses AI to categorize the file where the finding was identified based on its function, such as payments, user authentication, and infrastructure. |
| **Recommendation**     | Filter by recommendation offered by Semgrep Assistant's auto-triage feature. Possible values: <ul><li>Fix</li><li>Ignore</li></ul> |
| **Action**             | Filter by monitoring, commenting, or blocking rules in your Policies. |
| **Rule**               | Filter by rules included in your Policies page. You can select more than one rule or ruleset for filtering. |
| **Ruleset**            | Filter by the ruleset name where rules that match the code belong. More than one rule or ruleset can be selected for filtering. |

#### Finding categories

A finding can be categorized in two ways:

1. **Finding categorization based on the issue or code it detects**:
    - Anti-patterns
    - Security vulnerabilities (such as dangerous function usage)
    - Business or logic bugs
    - Matches based on your own custom rules (such as organization-specific authentication logic)

    Semgrep rules provide a metadata schema to identify these common categories. Semgrep findings include a `message` field that describes the security issue or bug found in matching code. Additionally, findings can provide a `fix` field that fixes the issue by creating a suggestion within your source code management (SCM) tool, such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
2. **Finding categorization based on the validity of the match**:
    <dl>
       <dt>True positive</dt>
       <dd>Rules are written to match a certain code pattern. A true positive is a genuine match. The rule is capturing the code as intended.</dd>
       <dt>False positive</dt>
       <dd>
        A false positive is a mismatch between the intended purpose of the rule and the code it matched. A finding is generated but does not meet the rule's intended need. Rules with a high false positivity rate are said to be <strong>noisy</strong>.
       </dd>
       <dt>False negative</dt>
       <dd>
        A false negative is a finding that should have been found by a rule, but was not. This can happen for two reasons:
        <ul>
            <li>A flaw in the rule's logic. See <a href="/docs/reporting-false-negatives">Reporting false negatives</a>.</li>
            <li>A bug within Semgrep itself. See the list of <a href="https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/issues">Semgrep issues</a> to file a bug report.</li>
        </ul>
        </dd>
    </dl>
