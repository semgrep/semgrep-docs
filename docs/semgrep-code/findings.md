# View findings in Semgrep AppSec Platform

Semgrep Code generates a **finding** when a rule matches a piece of code in your codebase. You can use Semgrep AppSec Platform's [**Code > Production backlog** page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings) to view all of the findings generated by Semgrep Code after it scans your codebase.

![Semgrep AppSec Platform's Production backlog page](/img/app-findings-overview.png)

Semgrep Assistant users can also view the [**Pre-production**](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open&last_opened=All+time&backlog=preprod) list of findings. This beta feature allows users to see the findings that have been [filtered out by Assistant](/semgrep-assistant/customize#noise-filtering) for auditing purposes.

## Navigate to the Production and Pre-production backlogs

To view your findings in the Production backlog:

1. Log in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Click **[Code](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings)**.

To view your findings in the Pre-production backlog:

1. Log in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Click **[Code > Pre-production](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open&last_opened=All+time&backlog=preprod)**.

## Page structure

The page structure of the Production backlog and Pre-production tabs are identical. These pages consist of:

- The **top bar**, where you can set the page's grouping view and [time period](#time-period-and-triage).
- The **filter panel**, which you can use to group and filter for specific findings.
- Information about findings identified by Semgrep Code. Each finding in the list includes:
  - The name and description of the rule used to generate the finding.
  - The name of the project.
  - A link to the commit where the finding was first identified.
  - A link to the lines of code where the finding was most recently seen.

### Group findings

By default, Semgrep groups all of the findings by the rule Semgrep used to match the code. This view is called the **Group by Rule** view.

Semgrep sorts findings by severity. For a given severity, Semgrep further sorts findings as follows:

1. Findings generated by custom rules
2. Findings generated by [Pro rules](/semgrep-code/pro-rules)
3. Issue count in descending order
4. Findings ID in ascending order

![Findings grouped by rule](/img/app-findings.png#md-width)

To view findings individually, toggle **Group by Rule** to **No grouping** using the drop-down menu in the header. Findings are displayed based on the date they were found, with the most recent finding listed at the top.

### Filter findings

Use filters to narrow down your results. The following criteria are available for filtering:

| Filter                 | Description  |
| ---------------------  | ------------ |
| **Projects and branches** | Filter by repositories connected to Semgrep AppSec Platform and by findings in different Git branches. |
| **Tags**               | Filter for findings based on the tags associated with the project. |
| **Status**             | Filter the triage state of a finding. Refer to [Triage statuses](/semgrep-code/triage-remediation#triage-statuses) to understand triage states. You can filter findings with a status of **Ignored** further by reason: **False positive**, **Acceptable risk**, **No time to fix**, or **No triage reason**. |
| **Severity**           | Filter by the severity of a finding. Severity is computed based on the values assigned for [Likelihood](/contributing/contributing-to-semgrep-rules-repository/#likelihood) and [Impact](/contributing/contributing-to-semgrep-rules-repository/#impact) by the rule's author. Possible values: <ul><li>Low</li><li>Medium</li><li>High</li><li>Critical</li></ul> |
| **Confidence**         | Filter by the likelihood of the rule to detect true positives. The higher the confidence, the more true positives the rule may detect. |
| **Pro findings only**       | Filter for findings identified using Semgrep Pro rules. Also includes findings originating from cross-file or cross-function analysis. |
| **Category**           | Filter by the type of security issue or vulnerability the rule detects, such as `security`, `correctness`, and `maintainability`. You can select more than one category at a time. See [Finding categories](#finding-categories) for information on how Semgrep categorizes your findings. |
| **Assistant risk category** | Filter for findings based on Assistant's assessment of risk level of files based on the type of code identified. High-risk files contain sensitive information, such as authorization and authentication details, while low-risk files may be things like test files. You can further filter by file type, such as **payments** or **tests**. |
| **Assistant autotriage** | Filter by whether [Assistant autotriage](/semgrep-assistant/overview#auto-triage) has determined the finding to be a **True positive** or **False positive**.  |
| **Action**             | Filter by monitoring, commenting, or blocking rules in your Policies. |
| **Rule**               | Filter by rules included in your Policies page. You can select more than one rule or ruleset for filtering. |
| **Ruleset**            | Filter by the ruleset name where rules that match the code belong. More than one rule or ruleset can be selected for filtering. |

#### Finding categories

A finding can be categorized in two ways:

1. **Finding categorization based on the issue or code it detects**:
    - Anti-patterns
    - Security vulnerabilities (such as dangerous function usage)
    - Business or logic bugs
    - Matches based on your own custom rules (such as organization-specific authentication logic)

    Semgrep rules provide a metadata schema to identify these common categories. Semgrep findings include a `message` field that describes the security issue or bug found in matching code. Additionally, findings can provide a `fix` field that fixes the issue by creating a suggestion within your source code management (SCM) tool, such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
2. **Finding categorization based on the validity of the match**:
    - **True positive**: Rules are written to match a certain code pattern. A true positive is a genuine match. The rule is capturing the code as intended.
    - **False positive**: A false positive is a mismatch between the intended purpose of the rule and the code it matched. A finding is generated but does not meet the rule's intended need. Rules with a high false positivity rate are said to be **noisy**.
    - **False negative**: A false negative is a finding that should have been found by a rule, but was not. This can happen for two reasons:
      1. A flaw in the rule's logic. See <a href="/docs/reporting-false-negatives">Reporting false negatives</a>.
      2. A bug within Semgrep itself. See the list of <a href="https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/issues">Semgrep issues</a> to file a bug report.

### View details about a specific finding

To view in-depth information about a specific finding:

1. Select the finding whose details you want to view:
    - If the default **Group by Rule** is enabled, click the <i class="fa-regular fa-window-restore"></i> **Details** icon on the card of the finding.
        ![Click View details if Group by Rule is enabled](/img/cloud-platform-findings-group-by-rule-view-details.png#md-width)
    - If the **No grouping** view is enabled, click the **header hyperlink** on the card of the finding. In the example screenshot below, the link is labeled **detected-generic-api-key**.
        ![Click View details if No grouping is enabled](/img/cloud-platform-findings-no-grouping-view-details.png#md-width)

#### Semgrep Assistant’s rule and analysis explanation 

When Semgrep Assistant is enabled and classifies a finding as a true or false positive, an alert appears at the top of the finding’s details page. You can also view a detailed explanation that, if applicable, includes steps to exploitability in the **Finding description** tab.

For true positives, the detailed explanation includes a summary and rationale for why the finding was flagged. It draws on the code that matched the rule pattern and the surrounding code to provide context for the rule message. For security-related rules, it also explains how the finding relates to the rule’s threat model.

For false positives, the explanation contains only Assistant’s reasoning, without additional code context. Some explanations refer to memories, which Assistant uses to determine whether a finding is a false positive. However, memories are not used when generating the explanation itself.

If Assistant flags a finding as a false positive, you can provide feedback by selecting **Agree and Ignore** or **Disagree**.

#### Add notes to findings

To **add notes** to the activity history of a finding:

1. Select a finding where you want to view details or add notes, and then do one of the following actions:
    - If the default **Group by Rule** is enabled, click <i class="fa-regular fa-window-restore"></i> **Details** icon on the card of the finding.
        ![Click View details if Group by Rule is enabled](/img/cloud-platform-findings-group-by-rule-view-details.png#md-width)
    - If **No grouping** view is enabled, click the **header hyperlink** on the card of the finding. In the example screenshot below, the link is labeled **detected-generic-api-key**.
        ![Click View details if No grouping is enabled](/img/cloud-platform-findings-no-grouping-view-details.png#md-width)
2. View or add the notes in the **Activity** section. To add a new note, click **New note**.
