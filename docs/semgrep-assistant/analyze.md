# Analyze findings with Semgrep Assistant

Once you've [enabled Assistant](/docs/semgrep-assistant/getting-started), you can use the **Analyze** button on the [Findings page](/semgrep-code/findings) to trigger all Assistant functions, including autofix, auto-triage, and component tagging, on existing findings.

To analyze your findings with Assistant:

1. On the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page, select the findings that you want Assistant to analyze.
2. Click **Analyze**.
3. In the confirmation dialog that appears, confirm that you want to analyze your findings with Assistant.

After Assistant performs these functions, you can see its results on the **Code** page using the **Recommendation** or **Component** filters. When viewing your findings, you can see false positive and true positive recommendations in a finding's **Details** page.

The amount of time required to analyze your findings varies. Before running the analysis, the confirmation dialog provides an estimated wait time.

:::info
- For Team tier users with less than 10 contributors: There is a cap of 50 Assistant runs per month using the **Analyze** button.
- For Team or Enterprise users with an active subscription: There is a cap of 10,000 Assistant runs per month using the **Analyze** button. It is rate-limited to 1,000 Assistant runs per hour.
- For users of any tier: Assistant runs against pull requests and merge requests do not count against this limit.

## View recommendations

You can [view all of Semgrep Assistant's recommendations](/semgrep-code/findings/#filter-findings) by going to the Semgrep **Findings** page and filtering by **Recommendation** or **Component**.

## Feedback

Semgrep Assistant prompts you for feedback whenever it suggests that a finding is a false positive. Because Assistant content is generated by language models (LLMs), your feedback helps the Semgrep team improve Assistant.

Semgrep Assistant lets you leave feedback in the following places:

* In Semgrep AppSec Platform: the Assistant recommendation appears in Semgrep Code's **Finding Details** page under **Activity**, along with **Agree and ignore** or **Disagree** buttons. 
* In Slack notifications: the **Agree** and **Disagree** buttons appear under the Assistant recommendation message.
* In GitHub pull requests: you can leave feedback using `/semgrep assistant agree|disagree`.

If Semgrep Assistant suggests that a finding is a true positive and supplies an autofix suggestion, there is no automated mechanism to leave feedback on this outcome. Feel free to contact the Semgrep team at [<i class="fa-regular fa-envelope"></i> support@semgrep.com](mailto:support@semgrep.com) to let us know your thoughts.
