# Analyze Semgrep Code findings with Semgrep Assistant

Once you've [enabled Assistant](/docs/semgrep-assistant/getting-started), you can use the **Analyze** button on the [Findings page](/semgrep-code/findings) to trigger all Assistant functions for Semgrep Code, including autofix, auto-triage, and component tagging, on existing findings.

## Analyze your findings with Assistant

1. On the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page, select the findings that you want Assistant to analyze.
2. Click **Analyze**.
3. In the confirmation dialog that appears, confirm that you want to analyze your findings with Assistant.

After Assistant performs these functions, you can see its results on the **Code** page using the **Recommendation** or **Component** filters. When viewing your findings, you can see false positive and true positive recommendations in a finding's **Details** page.

The amount of time required to analyze your findings varies. Before running the analysis, the confirmation dialog provides an estimated wait time.

:::info
- For Team tier users with less than 10 contributors: There is a cap of 50 Assistant runs per month using the **Analyze** button.
- For Team or Enterprise users with an active subscription: There is a cap of 10,000 Assistant runs per month using the **Analyze** button. It is rate-limited to 1,000 Assistant runs per hour.
- For users of any tier: Assistant runs against pull requests (PRs) and merge requests (MRs) do not count against this limit.

## When Assistant auto-analyzes findings

Assistant automatically analyzes new findings from a **full scan** that have **Critical** or **High** severity AND **High** or **Medium** confidence.

On a diff-aware scan, Assistant analyzes up to 10 new findings, regardless of severity or confidence.

## Findings that are not auto-analyzed

Assistant doesn't automatically analyze:

- Findings that were created before automatic analysis was enabled for your deployment. Automatic analysis for full scans was enabled in November 2025.
- The eleventh finding or later on the same PR or MR. Only the first 10 are automatically analyzed.

## Request analysis for existing findings

If you want Assistant analyses for findings that weren't automatically analyzed, you can request them in bulk through Semgrep AppSec Platform.

1. Go to the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page.
2. Select the findings you want Assistant to analyze. You can select individual findings or use filters to select multiple findings at once.
3. Click **Analyze**.
4. In the confirmation dialog, review the estimated wait time and confirm the request.

After Assistant completes the analysis, you can view recommendations in the finding's **Details** page or filter findings by **Assistant file risk levels** or **Assistant autotriage** on the Findings page.

If you need assistance with bulk analysis requests or have questions about backfilling analyses for your findings, contact [Semgrep Support](/support).

## View Assistant recommendations

You can [view all of Semgrep Assistant's recommendations](/semgrep-code/findings/#filter-findings) by going to the Semgrep **Findings** page and filtering by **Recommendation** or **Component**.

## Provide feedback on Assistant recommendations

Semgrep Assistant prompts you for feedback whenever it suggests that a finding is a false positive. Because Assistant content is generated by large language models (LLMs), your feedback helps the Semgrep team improve Assistant.

Semgrep Assistant lets you leave feedback in the following places:

* In Semgrep AppSec Platform: the Assistant recommendation appears in Semgrep Code's **Finding Details** page under **Activity**, along with **Agree and ignore** or **Disagree** buttons. 
* In Slack notifications: the **Agree** and **Disagree** buttons appear under the Assistant recommendation message.

If Semgrep Assistant suggests that a finding is a true positive and supplies an autofix suggestion, there is no automated mechanism to leave feedback on this outcome. Feel free to contact [Semgrep Support](/support) to let us know your thoughts.
