# Analyze Semgrep Code findings with Semgrep Assistant

Once you've [enabled Assistant](/docs/semgrep-assistant/getting-started), you can use the **Analyze** button on the [Findings page](/semgrep-code/findings) to trigger all Assistant functions for Semgrep Code, including autofix, auto-triage, and component tagging, on existing findings.

## How to analyze your findings with Assistant

1. On the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page, select the findings that you want Assistant to analyze.
2. Click **Analyze**.
3. In the confirmation dialog that appears, confirm that you want to analyze your findings with Assistant.

After Assistant performs these functions, you can see its results on the **Code** page using the **Recommendation** or **Component** filters. When viewing your findings, you can see false positive and true positive recommendations in a finding's **Details** page.

The amount of time required to analyze your findings varies. Before running the analysis, the confirmation dialog provides an estimated wait time.

:::info
- For Team tier users with less than 10 contributors: There is a cap of 50 Assistant runs per month using the **Analyze** button.
- For Team or Enterprise users with an active subscription: There is a cap of 10,000 Assistant runs per month using the **Analyze** button. It is rate-limited to 1,000 Assistant runs per hour.
- For users of any tier: Assistant runs against pull requests (PRs) and merge requests (MRs) do not count against this limit.

## When Assistant auto-analyzes findings

Assistant will automatically generate an analysis for any new finding on a full scan that is:
- Critical or High severity, or
- High or Medium confidence.

It will also analyze up to 10 new findings, regardless of severity or confidence, on a PR or MR.


## Findings that are not auto-analyzed

Assistant won't automatically analyze:

- Updated findings: Findings that are updates to existing issues rather than new findings
- Duplicate findings: Findings that are duplicates of existing findings
- Historical findings: Findings that were created before automatic analysis was enabled for your deployment. Automatic analysis for full scans was enabled in November 2025.
- Additional PR or MR findings: The eleventh finding or later on the same PR or MR (only the first 10 are automatically analyzed)

## Request analysis for existing findings

If you want Assistant analyses for findings that weren't automatically analyzed (as described above), you can request them in bulk through Semgrep AppSec Platform.

If you need assistance with bulk analysis requests or have questions about backfilling analyses for your findings, contact [Semgrep Support](/support).

## View Assistant recommendations

You can [view all of Semgrep Assistant's recommendations](/semgrep-code/findings/#filter-findings) by going to the Semgrep **Findings** page and filtering by **Recommendation** or **Component**.

## Provide feedback on Assistant recommendations

Semgrep Assistant prompts you for feedback whenever it suggests that a finding is a false positive. Because Assistant content is generated by large language models (LLMs), your feedback helps the Semgrep team improve Assistant.

Semgrep Assistant lets you leave feedback in the following places:

* In Semgrep AppSec Platform: the Assistant recommendation appears in Semgrep Code's **Finding Details** page under **Activity**, along with **Agree and ignore** or **Disagree** buttons. 
* In Slack notifications: the **Agree** and **Disagree** buttons appear under the Assistant recommendation message.
* In GitHub PRs: you can leave feedback using `/semgrep assistant agree|disagree`.

If Semgrep Assistant suggests that a finding is a true positive and supplies an autofix suggestion, there is no automated mechanism to leave feedback on this outcome. Feel free to contact [Semgrep Support](/support) to let us know your thoughts.
