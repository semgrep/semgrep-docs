# Analyze findings with Semgrep Assistant

Once you've [enabled Assistant](/docs/semgrep-assistant/getting-started), you can use the **Analyze** button on the [Findings page](/semgrep-code/findings) to trigger all Assistant functions, including autofix, auto-triage, and component tagging, on existing findings.

To analyze your findings with Assistant:

1. On the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page, select the findings that you want Assistant to analyze.
2. Click **Analyze**.
3. In the confirmation window that appears, confirm that you want to analyze your findings with Assistant.

After Assistant performs these functions, you can see your results on the **Findings** page using the **Recommendation** or **Component** filters. When viewing your findings, you can see false positive and true positive recommendations when viewing the finding details pages if you choose **No Grouping** instead of **Group by Rule**.

The amount of time required to analyze your findings varies, but the UI displays a notification that provides an estimated wait time.

:::info
- For Team tier users with less than 10 contributors: There is a cap of 50 Assistant runs per month using the **Analyze** button.
- For Team or Enterprise users with an active subscription: There is a cap of 10,000 Assistant runs per month using the **Analyze** button. It is rate-limited to 1,000 Assistant runs per hour.
- For users of any tier: Assistant runs against pull requests and merge requests do not count against this limit.

## View recommendations

You can [view all of Semgrep Assistant's recommendations](/semgrep-code/findings/#filter-findings) by going to the Semgrep **Findings** page and filtering by **Recommendation** or **Component**.

## Feedback

Semgrep Assistant prompts you for feedback whenever it suggests that a finding is a false positive. Because Assistant content is generated by language models (LLMs), your feedback helps the Semgrep team improve Assistant.

* In Semgrep AppSec Platform, the Assistant recommendation appears under **Activity** for a finding, along with **Agree and ignore** or **Disagree** buttons.
* In Slack notifications, **Agree** and **Disagree** buttons appear under the Assistant recommendation message.
* In GitHub pull requests, you can leave feedback using `/semgrep assistant agree|disagree`.

If Semgrep Assistant suggests that a finding is a true positive and supplies an autofix suggestion, there is no automated mechanism to leave feedback on this outcome. Feel free to contact the Semgrep team using one of the methods below to let us know your thoughts.
