# Semgrep Assistant overview

Semgrep Assistant provides GPT-4-powered security recommendations to help you review, triage, and remediate your Semgrep findings.

## Support and availability

Semgrep Assistant supports findings generated by Semgrep Code, Semgrep Supply Chain, and Semgrep Secrets.

In many cases, Semgrep Assistant requires the use of Semgrep Cloud Platform. It is not available on the Semgrep CLI.

Semgrep Assistant is available to users of the following source code managers (SCMs):
    * GitHub Cloud
    * All GitLab plans, both SaaS and self-managed

Semgrep Assistant does not support GitHub Enterprise Server (self-hosted).

### Language support

Semgrep Assistant supports all the same languages as Semgrep Code. See [Supported languages](/supported-languages) for more information.

## Features

Semgrep Assistant can:

* **Auto-triage findings**: Semgrep Assistant can automatically triage findings, determining if a finding is a false positive or not.
* **Auto-fix code**: Semgrep Assistant recommends auto-fixes whenever it identifies a true positive. Developers can review and verify Semgrep's generated fixes before they're applied.
* **Leave comments for developers in pull requests and merge requests**: Semgrep Assistant can surface its recommendations, including whether a finding is a false positive and can be ignored safely, via PR or MR comments, so that developers can fix or triage an issue without needing to switch contexts.
* **Send notifications via Slack**: Semgrep Assistant can alert you regarding findings that seem safe to ignore via Slack notifications. 

## Feedback

Semgrep Assistant prompts you for feedback whenever it suggests that a finding is a false postive. Because Assistant content is generated by language models (LLMs), y our feedback helps the Semgrep team improve Assistant.

* In Semgrep Cloud Platform, the Assistant recommendation appears under **Activity** for a finding, along with **Agree and ignore** or **Disagree** buttons.
* In Slack notifications, **Agree** and **Disagree** buttons appear under the Assistant recommendation message.
* In GitHub pull requests, you can leave feedback using `/semgrep assistant agree|disagree`.

If Semgrep Assistant suggests that a finding is a true positive and supplies an autofix suggestion, there is no automated mechanism to leave feedback on this outcome. Feel free to contact the Semgrep team using one of the methods below to let us know your thoughts!

## Privacy and legal considerations

Semgrep gets API permissions to access code on your pre-selected GitHub or GitLab repositories.

* Semgrep Assistant logs and stores the GPT prompts and responses for the sake of performance evaluation, which include source code snippets.
* Semgrep Assistant sends relevant lines of code to OpenAI's API, where currently, the "relevant lines of code" means lines that are part of the Semgrep finding, plus 10 lines of context on each side. Semgrep, Inc. is likely to expand this, potentially to the entire file, as we learn how to pass more useful context.
* Semgrep stores and retains GPT's responses based on these code snippets for up to 6 months. Semgrep, Inc. will update you with at least a 30-day notice if we make any changes to the retention policy.
* Semgrep, Inc. is a paying customer of OpenAI and has a Data Protection Agreement signed with them (provided upon request by [contacting support](/docs/support). The code snippets we upload are persisted by OpenAI temporarily, following their data usage policies at [Open AI API data Usage Policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).
* Semgrep, Inc. takes the following steps to protect data that is processed by AI since Assistant requires the sharing of code snippets with a third party:
  * Semgrep shares code snippets with OpenAI without identifying the customer or repository name.
  * Semgrep only shares the code necessary to enlist the help of GPT in automating the resolution of each specific alert.
  * Semgrep only accesses source code repositories on a file-by-file basis; it does not need or request org-level access to your codebase.
* When using Semgrep Assistant, source code **does** leave your repository; Assistant submits part of the file with a finding to OpenAI for processing by a GPT model. OpenAI is not allowed to use the submitted code for training their models.
* Regarding your data privacy, none of your personal information is shared with OpenAI as a part of the Semgrep Assistant feature.
* Semgrep, Inc. and OpenAI do not obtain any rights to your source code. Your source code remains yours, and Semgrep or OpenAI accesses it to the limited extent necessary to provide the Semgrep Assistant service. Once the results are returned to you, Semgrep Assistant deletes the shared snippets. OpenAI retains copies of the content sent to them for a maximum of 30 days to monitor for abuse, as indicated in their API Data Usage Policies.
* Because Semgrep Assistant accesses OpenAIâ€™s services through the API, OpenAI does not use any of the code provided to them to improve their services (see Section 3(c) of their Terms of Use).
* To a limited extent, using Semgrep Assistant changes the terms of your agreement with Semgrep, Inc. Specifically, sharing code snippets with Semgrep Assistant as part of this feature expands the scope of the data to which you grant Semgrep, Inc. a limited license to provide services to you (see Section 5.1 of our Subscriber Agreement).
