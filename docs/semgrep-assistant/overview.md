## Support and availability

Semgrep Assistant:

- Primarily supports findings generated by Semgrep Code
- Supports [the same languages as Semgrep Code](/supported-languages)
- Is available to users of the following source code managers (SCMs):
  - GitHub Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server (self-hosted)
  - GitLab, including SaaS and self-managed plans
- Requires the Semgrep AppSec Platform for its use

## Features

### Remediation

Semgrep Assistant can provide remediation advice and autofixes, or suggested fixes, for Semgrep Code findings.

#### Guidance

With Assistant enabled, every PR or MR comment Semgrep pushes includes remediation guidance with information on fixing the issue. Assistant's remediation guidance provides step-by-step instructions on how to remediate the finding identified by Semgrep Code.

Semgrep also displays remediation information on Semgrep AppSec Platform's **Findings page** under **Your code & fix** in the [finding's details](/docs/semgrep-code/findings/#view-findings-details-about-a-specific-finding) page.

#### Autofix

Semgrep Assistant can suggest [autofix](/writing-rules/autofix/) code snippets for Semgrep Code findings when it identifies a true positive. Assistant only suggests an autofix if the rule doesn't have a human-written autofix. You can set the minimum autofix confidence level required to display autofix suggestions from Semgrep Assistant on Semgrep AppSec Platform's **Settings** page. To receive as many Assistant suggestions as are available, set the minimum to **low confidence**.

Assistant customizes the code snippets it provides based on previous feedback, if any, and your rule customizations. For example, if you have a custom rule recommending a specific sanitizer, Assistant can recommend its use in the autofix suggestion for the issue in your code.

Autofixes are available in PR and MR comments, so developers can review and verify Semgrep's generated fixes before applying them.

Autofixes are also available on Semgrep AppSec Platform's **Findings page** under **Your code & fix** in the [finding's details](/docs/semgrep-code/findings/#view-findings-details-about-a-specific-finding).

The finding's details include a link to the PR or MR with the autofix, so you can go directly to the PR or MR to commit the autofix.

:::info
If many new issues are found in a given scan, Assistant auto-triage and autofix may not run on every issue.

### Component tags

**Component tags** use AI to categorize a finding based on its function, such as:

- Payments
- User authentication
- Infrastructure

By categorizing your code through component tags, Semgrep Assistant can help you prioritize **high-risk issues**, such as remediating a code finding related to payments or user authentication.

Component tags can be viewed in Semgrep AppSec Platform's **Findings** page.

### Auto-triage

Semgrep Assistant uses AI's understanding of programming languages and libraries, and your code and triage history, to auto-triage findings and suggest whether a finding can safely be ignored. For every recommendation to ignore a finding, Semgrep also provides guidance with an explanation on why this is the case.

Auto-triage recommendations are available in Semgrep AppSec Platform's **Findings** page when you filter for findings that Assistant suggests should be ignored, and in the [finding's details](/semgrep-code/findings/#view-findings-details-about-a-specific-finding).

Assistant's suggestions to ignore findings are also surfaced in PR or MR comments, so developers can triage an issue directly without leaving their PR or MR.

### Weekly priority emails

Semgrep sends weekly emails with information on Assistant's top three backlog tasks across all findings. Unlike other Assistant features, these suggestions can include information for all Semgrep products that you have enabled. The emails are sent out on Monday to all organization admins.

### Noise filtering (beta)

Noise filtering increases developer velocity by reducing interruptions from potential false positives. With Noise Filtering, Assistant evaluates each finding to determine if it's a true positive using additional context. If Assistant thinks a finding may be a false positive, it prevents a PR comment from being posted in the developer workflow. 

Security teams can review filtered findings at any time on Semgrep's [**Code > Pre-production** page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open&last_opened=All+time&backlog=preprod). Semgrep also allows you to agree or disagree with the filtering. If you agree with the suggestion, Semgrep closes the finding, but if you disagree, Semgrep reopens the finding.

Assistant is [over 95% accurate in categorizing Semgrep Code findings as false positives](/semgrep-assistant/metrics.md).

### Memories (beta)

Assistant Memories allows AppSec teams and developers to tailor Assistant's remediation guidance to their organization's standards and defaults on a per-project, per-rule basis. When Assistant gives a suggested fix, you can provide feedback by adding custom instructions.

For example, if the code contains a hardcoded secret, Assistant might suggest using an SDK that handles credentialing. However, if your company prefers to use a different secrets manager, you can provide this information to Assistant. Assistant then generates remediation guidance that works with your specific secrets manager in the future.

### Custom rules editor (beta)

Semgrep Assistant can help you write custom rules to find patterns and vulnerabilities specific to your codebase. The only information you need to provide is a prompt describing what you want the rule to do in English. However, if you provide an example of bad code and an example of good code, Semgrep uses this information for you to test the generated rule and provide context to the language model (LLM).
