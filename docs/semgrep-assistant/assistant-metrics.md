# Semgrep Assistant metrics and methodology

 
Our metrics for evaluating Semgrep Assistant's performance are derived from two key sources:
- **user feedback** on Assistant recommendations within the product
- **internal triage / benchmarking** conducted by our security research team 

This methodology ensures that Assistant is evaluated from both a user-centric perspective and through expert-driven technical scrutiny, giving our product and engineering teams a holistic view into Assistant's real-world performance. 

For example, user feedback provides a comprehensive look into the accuracy of Assistant auto-triage and noise filtering capabilities. Conversely, expert-review is better suited to determine the accuracy and effectiven

## User feedback (real-world dataset)
User feedback shows the aggregated and anonymized performance of Assistant across **1000+ customers**, providing a comprehensive real-world dataset. 

The user feedback loop is baked into product workflows to ensure comprehensiveness and to reduce sampling bias. Users are prompted in-line to "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" Assistant suggestions. 


**Results as of December 10, 2024:**


|                        |         |
|------------------------|---------|
| Customers in dataset   | **1000+**|
| Findings analyzed | **250,000+** |
| Human-agree rate       | **95%** |
| Median time to resolution     | **22% faster than baseline** |
| Average time saved per finding   | **30 minutes** |


## Internal benchmarks (internal dataset)
Internal benchmarks for Assistant utilize a systemic process in which a rotating team of security engineers conduct periodic reviews of Assistant generated remediation guidance. 

Internal benchmarks for Assistant run on the same dataset used by our security research team to analyze Semgrep rule performance. This means the dataset is not prone to cherry-picked findings that are easier for AI to analyze, and accurately represents real-world performance across a variety of contexts. 

**Results as of December 10, 2024:**

|                        |         |
|------------------------|---------|
| Findings analyzed  | **X**|
| Average signal boost[^1] | **20%**|
| False positive confidence rate[^2]      | **98%** |
| Remediation guidance confidence rate[^3]    | **80%** |

[^1]:Signal boost is the % of findings in a project scan that Assistant filters out as noise.  

[^2]:False positive confidence rate measures how often Assistant is correct when it identifies a false positive. **A high confidence rate means users can trust when Assistant identifies a false positive - it does not mean that Assistant catches all false positives.** 

[^3]:Remediation guidance is rated on a binary scale of "helpful" / "not helpful".
