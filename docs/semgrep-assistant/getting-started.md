This article walks you through enabling Semgrep Assistant for your deployment.

:::info Prerequisites
* You have completed a [Semgrep core deployment](/deployment/core-deployment).
* You have set rules to **Comment** or **Block** mode in your [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-sm"></i> Policies page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/policies).

Semgrep Assistant extends normal Semgrep capabilities by providing contextually aware AI-generated suggestions. In order to build that context, it requires GitHub permissions in addition to the 
[<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> standard permissions required for Semgrep](/deployment/checklist/#permissions).

Semgrep Assistant requires [read access to your code in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-github-apps?apiVersion=2022-11-28). This is done through a private Semgrep GitHub app that you install during Assistant setup. This private Semgrep GitHub app:

* Is fully under your control so you can revoke access or specific permissions at any time by visiting **Settings > Applications** in GitHub.
* Only accesses source code repositories on a file-by-file basis; it does not need or request org-level access to your codebase.
* Can be configured to limit its scope to specific repositories. You do not need to give read access to all repositories in your GitHub organization. 

## Enable Assistant

1. Sign in to [Semgrep Cloud Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Click **[<i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> Settings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/)**. 
3. In the **Assistant** section, click the **<i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> Allow code snippets in AI prompts** toggle.
![Screenshot of Semgrep Assistant setup button](/img/semgrep-assistant-setup.png#md-width)
   This launches the **Set up Semgrep Assistant** prompt.
1. Select a source code manager (SCM) by clicking **github.com**.
2. Semgrep provides you with information on why Assistant requires access to your source code. Click **Accept & Enable Assistant** to proceed.
3. You are redirected to the page where you can add a GitHub Private App that grants Semgrep read access to your code.
   1. Enter your GitHub information. Select whether you're installing the app on an **organization** or **Personal Account**, and provide its name.
   2. Click **Review permissions** to see the permissions requested by Semgrep.
   3. Click **Register GitHub App** to proceed.
   4. When prompted, click **Continue** to allow redirection to GitHub to finalize app creation. Follow the instructions to finish creating and installing a private `semgrep-app`.
4. You are redirected to Semgrep Cloud Platform's **Source Code Managers** page. Navigate back to the **Deployment** page. Under the **Assistant** section, verify that all of the features are enabled:
   1. **Allow code snippets in AI prompts**: Required for Semgrep to auto-triage findings, provide AI remediation guidance, and tag findings with code context.
   2. **Autofix suggestions for Code**: Enable autofix suggestions in comments from Assistant. You can also set the minimum confidence level for Assistant-written fixes if the Semgrep rule doesn't include a human-written autofix.
   3. **Auto-triage for Code**: Enable notifications whenever Assistant suggests that a finding may be safe to ignore. You can include notifications in your PR and MR comments, or you can receive them through Slack notifications.

Semgrep Assistant extends normal Semgrep capabilities by providing contextually aware AI-generated suggestions. In order to build that context, it requires GitLab permissions in addition to the 
[<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> standard permissions required for Semgrep](/deployment/checklist/#permissions).

Semgrep Assistant requires the **API scope** to run in both GitLab SaaS and GitLab self-managed instances. This can be specified at either the [project access token level](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html) or [personal access token level](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html). 

* You can revoke [project access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html#revoke-a-project-access-token) or [personal access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#revoke-a-personal-access-token) at any time. 
* Semgrep Assistant only accesses source code repositories (projects) on a file-by-file basis; it does not need or request org-level access to your codebase.
* The token can be configured to limit its scope to specific projects or individuals. You do not need to give read access to all projects in your GitLab organization.

<h2>Enable Assistant</h2>

1. Sign in to [Semgrep Cloud Platform <i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i>](https://semgrep.dev/login) using your GitLab account.
2. Click **[<i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> Settings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/)**. 
3. In the **Assistant** section, click the **<i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> Allow code snippets in AI prompts** toggle.
![Screenshot of Semgrep Assistant setup button](/img/semgrep-assistant-setup.png#md-width)
   This launches the **Set up Semgrep Assistant** prompt.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup process.
5. Navigate back to the **Deployment** page. Under the **Assistant** section, verify that all of the features are enabled:
   1. **Allow code snippets in AI prompts**: Required for Semgrep to auto-triage findings, provide AI remediation guidance, and tag findings with code context.
   2. **Autofix suggestions for Code**: Enable autofix suggestions in comments from Assistant. You can also set the minimum confidence level for Assistant-written fixes if the Semgrep rule doesn't include a human-written autofix.
   3. **Auto-triage for Code**: Enable notifications whenever Assistant suggests that a finding may be safe to ignore. You can include notifications in your PR and MR comments, or you can receive them through Slack notifications.

### Enable autofix suggestions

Autofix allows you to receive code snippets to remediate true positives. Perform the following to enable it:

1. Sign in to Semgrep Cloud Platform, and navigate to **Settings > Deployment**.
2. In the **Assistant** section, click the **Autofix suggestions for Code** <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-large-on"></i> if it is not yet enabled.
3. *Optional*: Select a **confidence level** in the drop-down box. This value determines the level of quality at which the autofix code appears as a suggestion. A lower confidence level means that Semgrep Assistant displays the autofix suggestion even when the code quality may be incorrect.
    :::tip
    Semgrep recommends setting a low confidence level since even incorrect suggestions may be useful starting points for triage and remediation.
    :::

### Enable auto-triage

If [auto-triage](/semgrep-assistant/overview/#autotriage), which allows you to get notifications whenever Assistant indicates a finding may be safe to ignore, isn't enabled for your deployment, you can do so as follows:

1. Sign in to Semgrep Cloud Platform, and navigate to **Settings > Deployment**.
2. In the **Assistant** section, click the **Auto-triage for Code** <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-large-on"></i> if it is not yet enabled.
3. Select whether you want alerts included in your **PR/MR comments** and **Slack notifications**.

#### Missing PR and comments
Semgrep Assistant messages only appear in your PR comments for rules that are set to Comment or Block mode on the Rule Management page. Ensure that:

* You have set rules to Comment or Block mode.
  ![Screenshot of Policies modes](/img/semgrep-assistant-comment.png)
* You have selected PR/MR comments in **Semgrep Cloud Platform > Settings > Deployment** in the **Code** section.

## Analyze findings

Once you've enabled Assistant, you can use the **Analyze** button on the [Findings page](/semgrep-code/findings) to trigger all Assistant functions, including autofix, auto-triage, and component tagging, on existing findings.

![Assistant Analyze button on Findings page](/img/scp-assistant.png#md-width)

To analyze your findings with Assistant:

1. On the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page, select the findings that you want Assistant to analyze.
2. Click **Analyze**.
3. In the confirmation window that appears, confirm that you want to analyze your findings with Assistant.

After Assistant performs these functions, you can see your results on the **Findings** page using the **Recommendation** or **Component** filters. When viewing your findings, you can see false positive and true positive recommendations when viewing the finding details pages if you choose **No Grouping** instead of **Group by Rule**.

The amount of time required to analyze your findings varies, but SCP displays a notification that provides an estimated wait time.

:::info
There is a cap of 250 Assistant runs per month using the **Analyze** button. Assistant runs against pull requests and merge requests do not count against this limit.

## View recommendations

You can [view all of Semgrep Assistant's recommendations](/semgrep-code/findings/#filter-findings) by going to Semgrep Cloud Platform's **Findings** page and filtering by **Recommendation** or **Component**.
