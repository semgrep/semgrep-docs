# Supported languages

This document provides information about supported languages and language maturity definitions for the following products:

* Semgrep Code
* Semgrep OSS

For commercial Semgrep offerings, check the [Semgrep Pro > Supported languages](/supported-languages) page.

## Semgrep Code and OSS

Semgrep OSS is a fast, lightweight program analysis tool that can help you detect security issues in your code. It makes use of Semgrep's LGPL 2.1 open-source engine.

Semgrep Code is a static application security testing SAST solution that uses both Semgrep OSS Engine and a proprietary Semgrep Pro engine. This engine can perform more complex code analyses, resulting in a higher true positive rate than Semgrep OSS.

Use either tool to scan local code or integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the continuous scanning of your repositories.

### Language maturity levels
Semgrep Code languages can be classified into four maturity levels:

* Generally available (GA)
* Beta
* Experimental
* Community supported\*

\*Community supported languages meet the parse rate and syntax requirements of **Experimental** languages. Users can still access community rules or write their own rules.

Their differences are outlined in the following table:

<table>
    <thead><tr>
        <td><strong>Feature</strong></td>
        <td><strong>GA</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Beta</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Experimental</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Community supported</strong></td>
    </tr></thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Parse Rate</td>
        <td>99%+</td>
        <td>95%+</td>
        <td colspan="2">90%+</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Number of rules</td>
        <td>10+</td>
        <td>5+</td>
        <td colspan="2">0+. Query the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/r">Registry</a> to see if any rules exist for your language.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Semgrep syntax</td>
        <td>Regex, equivalence, deep expression operators, types and typing. All features supported in Beta.</td>
        <td>Complete metavariable support, metavariable equality. All features supported in Experimental.</td>
        <td colspan="2">Syntax, ellipsis operator, basic metavariable functionality.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Support</td>
        <td>Highest quality support by the Semgrep team. Reported issues are resolved promptly.</td>
        <td>Supported by the Semgrep team. Reported issues are fixed after GA languages.</td>
        <td>There are limitations to this language's functionality. Reported issues are tracked and prioritized with best effort.</td>
        <td>These languages are supported by the Semgrep community. While Semgrep may develop rules or engine updates for these languages, they are not prioritized.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Semgrep Code language support

Semgrep Code supports over 30 languages and counting! ðŸš€

<SupportedLanguagesTable />

### Semgrep OSS language support

**All Semgrep OSS languages are community supported.** Community supported languages meet the parse rate and syntax requirements of experimental languages in Semgrep Code. Semgrep OSS uses Semgrep's open source engine.

Community supported languages have varying levels of rule coverage - check the registry and filter out Pro rules to see the level of coverage for OSS.
