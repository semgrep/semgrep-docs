# Troubleshooting Semgrep

## Troubleshooting Semgrep CI

If you're seeing results reported on files that have not changed since the last scan, GitHub Actions timing out, or anything else related to running semgrep in CI, see instructions in sections below on your CI provider.

### Github

The first piece of information r2c uses are the GitHub Actions logs. You can send them to r2c by clicking the settings button next to **search logs** and then **download log archive**.

If this does not have the information you need, save the logs that Semgrep CI produces. On each run, Semgrep CI creates a `.semgrep_logs` folder with the following information:

- The debug logs
- The output collected from Semgrep (including the timing data described below).
- If a run used a Semgrep configuration, the flat list of rules run is listed.

To collect these logs, you need to upload them as an artifact. Modify your workflow to match the following:

```yaml
semgrep:
    name: semgrep with managed policy
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    env:
      SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN }}
    container:
      image: returntocorp/semgrep
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: semgrep ci
      - name: package-logs
        if: always()
        run: tar czf logs.tgz ~/.semgrep/last.log
      - name: upload-logs
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: logs.tgz
          path: logs.tgz
          retention-days: 1
```

### Retrieving Semgrep CI logs

When you run `semgrep ci --config p/ci` logs are saved in `~/.semgrep/last.log`.

### Reproducing the run locally

It is possible to reproduce some parts of Semgrep CI locally to aid in debugging through the following steps:

1. Go to the [API token page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/tokens) and create a new API token.
2. Run the following command, and then paste in your API key when prompted:
    ```
    semgrep login
    ```
3. Run the following code: <pre class="language-bash"><code>SEMGREP_REPO_NAME=<span className="placeholder">your-organization</span>/<span className="placeholder">repository-name</span> semgrep ci</code></pre>
For example, `SEMGREP_REPO_NAME=returntocorp/semgrep semgrep ci` would be used for the GitHub repository `returntocorp/semgrep`. As a result, Semgrep fetches the rules configured on all Semgrep App policies for this repository and run a local Semgrep scan using those rules.

## Troubleshooting Semgrep CLI

### Semgrep exited with code -11 (or -9)

This can happen when Semgrep crashes, usually as a result of memory exhaustion. `-11` and `-9` are the POSIX signals raised to cause the crash. Try increasing your stack limit, as suggested (`ulimit -s [limit]`). If you are working in a container where you can set the memory you are working with, you can also try increasing this limit. Alternatively, you can add `--max-memory [limit]` to your Semgrep run, which will stop a rule/file scan if it reaches the limit.

Additionally, you can run Semgrep in singlethreaded mode with `--jobs 1`.

When reporting these errors, please include the rule it failed on, the total size of the files (or the files themselves if possible!), the maximum memory used by Semgrep (an estimate from `top` is fine), and your system specifications.

### Semgrep is too slow

We record Semgrep runtimes for each file and rule. This information is displayed when you include `--time`. How you choose to interact with the `--time` output depends on your goals.

#### I am a user who just wants to run faster

Just run Semgrep with `--time` and not `--json`. This will output a list of the rules and files that took the longest. Oftentimes, users find that those files shouldn't have been scanned in the first place.

The first step to improving Semgrep's speed is limiting its run to only the files you care about. You can do this by adding a `.semgrepignore` file. See [how to ignore files & directories in Semgrep CI](/semgrep-ci/overview.md#ignoring-files-directories).

If you're still slow, you may want to examine the slowest rules. You may find that some of them don't apply to your codebase and can be skipped.

##### Interpreting the result object

For full timing information, run Semgrep with `--time` and `--json`. In addition, you will want to `time` the entire command to get the true wall time. Here is an example result object.

```JSON
{
  "errors": [],
  "results": [],
  "time": {
    "profiling_times": {
      "config_time": 0.10301780700683594,
      "core_time": 0.0883018970489502,
      "ignores_time": 2.7894973754882812e-05,
      "total_time": 0.1915416717529297
    },
    "rule_parse_info": [
      0.0011630058288574219
    ],
    "rules": [
      {
        "id": "Users.emma.workspace.testing.error_configs.use-sys-exit"
      }
    ],
    "targets": [
      {
        "match_times": [
          0
        ],
        "num_bytes": 444,
        "parse_times": [
          0
        ],
        "path": "/Users/emma/workspace/testing/situations_test/no_token_location.py",
        "run_times": [
          0.0006248950958251953
        ]
      }
    ],
    "total_bytes": 444
  }
}
```

All the information about timing is contained under `time`.

The first section is `profiling_times`. This contains wall time durations of various steps we consider interesting: getting the rule config files (`config_time`), running the main engine (`core_time`), and processing the ignores (`ignores_time`). The `total_time` field represents the sum of these steps.

The remaining fields report engine performance. Together, `rule_parse_info` and `targets` should capture all the time spent running `semgrep-core`.

`rule_parse_info` is straightfoward. It records the time spent parsing each rule.

`targets` poses more difficulty. Since files are run in parallel, the amount of time spent parsing (`parse_times`) and matching (`match_times`) will inevitably be meaningless compared against `total_time` or `core_time`. Therefore, the total run time (`run_times`) of each target for each rule is taken within the parallel run. This helps contextualize the time spent parsing and matching each target. The sum of the run times thus can (and uusally should) be longer than the total time.

The lists `rule_parse_info`, `match_times`, `parse_times`, and `run_times` are all in the same order as `rules`. That is, the parse time of rule `rules[0]` is `rule_parse_info[0]`.

Note that `parse_times` is given for each rule, but a file should only be parsed once (the first number). Afterwards, the parse time represents the time spent retrieving the file's AST from the cache.

##### Negative values in the metrics

When a time is not measured, by default it has the value -1. It is common to a have a normal runtime but -1 for the parse time or match time; this indicates an error in parsing.

##### Tips for exploring semgrep results

There are several scripts already written to analyze and summarize these timing data. Find them in [`scripts/processing-output`](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/tree/develop/scripts/processing-output). If you have a timing file, you will probably want to run

```bash
python read_timing.py [your_timing_file]
```

You may need to adjust the line `result_times = results` based on whether you have a timing file or the full results (in which case this should be `result_times = results["time"]`)
