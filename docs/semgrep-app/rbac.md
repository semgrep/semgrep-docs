# Controlling access through roles

![Screenshot of role-based access control ](../img/rbac-overview.png)<br />

Access control in Semgrep App determines the resources and features that are available to users based on their role. This **role-based access control (RBAC)** feature is available for organizations on Team/Enterprise tiers.

## Setting up RBAC

Semgrep App divides users into two roles:

* `admin`
* `member`

:::info
Users in organizations without RBAC enabled are `admin` by default.
:::
:::info
Community-tier (Free) users are `admin` by default.

The following table displays features available to each role:

| Feature               | `member`  | `admin`   | Additional notes                                                                   |

To enable RBAC, please contact r2c at [support@r2c.dev](mailto:support@r2c.dev).

Upon enabling RBAC for the first time, current members of the organization are `admins`. New members added thereafter are automatically `members`.

## Changing a user's role

**Prerequisites**:

* You must be an `admin` to perform this operation.
* You may need to log out and log back in after enabling RBAC for your organization.

1. On Semgrep App's sidebar, click Settings.
2. Click on the Members tab.
3. Search for the member whose role will be changed.
4. Click on the member's current role, under the role header. A drop-down box appears.
5. Select the new role for the member.
