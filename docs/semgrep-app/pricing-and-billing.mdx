# Pricing and billing

## Can I use Semgrep for free?

Yes, you can use the Semgrep CLI and Semgrep Community Tier for [free](https://semgrep.dev/getting-started)!

## What are the differences between the free and paid plans?

Semgrep Community is great for individuals looking to quickly secure their public and private projects and teams looking to explore and try out the product.

Semgrep Team and Enterprise are best for larger organizations that require dedicated support and advanced functionality.

You can find more on the [pricing page](https://semgrep.dev/pricing).

## How many seats do I need?

One seat corresponds to one project contributor whose merge/pull request or code is scanned during the billing period.

For example, if a project has 4 unique contributors who push code during the billing period and Semgrep runs on their merge/pull requests, 4 seats are required. If these unique contributors commit to many projects within the same organization, they will only be counted once, so no additional seats are required.

## How do I upgrade my plan?

To upgrade to the Team tier, select the number of seats you wish to purchase and pay directly from the Settings page in Semgrep App!

For Enterprise tier pricing, please contact us via the form on the [pricing page](http://semgrep.dev/pricing).

## How do I pay for my plan?

We accept all major credit cards through [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). If you want to pay through a purchase order / invoice mechanism, you can also reach out to [billing@r2c.dev](mailto:billing@r2c.dev) to get in touch with our sales team.

We will bill you every month starting from when you upgraded your account.

## How do I modify my plan?

## What if I go over my planâ€™s limits?
