# Pricing and billing

The following Semgrep tools are free to use:

* Semgrep CLI
* Semgrep CI
* Semgrep App (through the Community tier)

Semgrep CLI is free open-source software (FOSS), licensed under LGPL 2.1. Semgrep CI is source-available. All features for both Semgrep CLI and Semgrep CI are free.

Semgrep App, which builds on Semgrep CLI and CI, enables developer teams to create their own institutional code standards, enforce them, and analyze findings. Semgrep App has both free and paid tiers.


## Choosing a Semgrep App tier

Semgrep App has three tiers:

## Determining your plan needs

## Upgrading your plan

## Modifying or canceling your plan

## Paying for your plan
