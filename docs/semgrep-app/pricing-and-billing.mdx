# Pricing and billing

The following Semgrep tools are free to use:

* Semgrep CLI
* Semgrep CI
* Semgrep App (through the Community tier)

Semgrep CLI is free open-source software (FOSS), licensed under LGPL 2.1. Semgrep CI is source-available. All features for both Semgrep CLI and Semgrep CI are free.

Semgrep App, which builds on Semgrep CLI and CI, enables developer teams to create their own institutional code standards, enforce them, and analyze findings. Semgrep App has both free and paid tiers.

## Choosing a Semgrep App tier

Semgrep App has three tiers:

| Tier | Price | Description |
| ---- | ------- | -------- | 
| **Community** | Free | For general-purpose security scanning.  |
| **Team** | $40/mo per seat | For the enforcement of company-specific coding standards, private rules, and the analysis of findings.  |
| **Enterprise** | Custom pricing | For custom solutions, including deployment into virtual private clouds (VPCs) with dedicated technical support.  |

Semgrep App integrates with a GitHub or GitLab account at either the organizational or individual level. There is no limit to the number of members in an organization for all tiers.

Billing depends on the number of **seats**. Any member whose code has been scanned by Semgrep App takes up a seat.

Members who do **not** run any scans on their code do not need a seat and are not billed. Semgrep Team tier features apply to the entire organization, even if not all members are billed for a seat.

### Comparing free and paid tier features

#### Organizational management

| Feature  | Community | Team | Enterprise |
| -------  | --------- | ------- | -------- |
| **Member limit** | ♾️ unlimited | ♾️  unlimited | ♾️  unlimited |

* **Custom rule messages** can be applied to public and private rules.

#### Deployment, integrations, and notifications

| Feature  | Community | Team | Enterprise |

* **Webhook integration** uses a generic webhook to send JSON messages. These messages are triggered when a policy is changed, a new scan runs, or a new finding has emerged.
* **Jira integration** allows organizations to directly create Jira tickets from a finding.

#### Authentication

## Determining your plan needs

### Number of seats

Within your team or organization, assess the number of members whose code needs scanning. That will determine the number of seats needed for purchase.

For example, if a project has 4 unique contributors who push code during the billing period and Semgrep runs on their merge/pull requests, only 4 seats are required even if the organization has a total of 10 members. If these unique contributors commit to many projects within the same organization, they will only be counted once, so no additional seats are required.

All members of the organization, regardless of seat status, have access to paid features for the chosen tier. This means that project managers and other non-programming roles can still view the Semgrep App dashboard.

### Plan limits

Should your plan exceed the limit, we will reach out and come up with a new plan that fits your needs.

## Upgrading your plan

To upgrade to the **Team tier** through **credit card**:

1. In the Settings page, select the Payment tab.
2. Select the number of seats to purchase.
