# Pricing and billing

The following Semgrep tools are free to use:

* Semgrep OSS Engine
* Semgrep Code (up to **20 developers** under the Community tier)

**Semgrep OSS Engine** is open source software (OSS), licensed under LGPL 2.1. It is a fast static analysis command line tool for finding bugs and enforcing code standards. It can be run locally or in continuous integration (CI).

**Semgrep Code**, which builds on Semgrep OSS Engine, provides additional features that enable developer and security teams to triage security vulnerabilities, set up notifications, and enforce organizational coding standards. Semgrep Code includes Semgrep Cloud Platform (SCP). Semgrep Code has both free and paid tiers.

Semgrep Code’s paid tiers include **Semgrep Pro Engine** and **Semgrep Pro rules**. These provide **interprocedural and interfile analysis**, producing high confidence findings for a variety of OWASP top ten vulnerabilities.

## Semgrep Code and Semgrep OSS Engine

The following tables provide an overview of features and their availability based on tier.

### Organizational management and usage limits

| Feature       | Semgrep OSS | Semgrep Code Community | Semgrep Code Team |
| -------       | --------- | ------- | -------- |
| **Member limit** | n/a | 20 developers | ♾️  unlimited |
| **Project limit** |n/a |♾️  unlimited | ♾️  unlimited |

Notes:

* Semgrep OSS does not support any member count function.
* Member usage limits are visible in your **[Settings page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings) > Upgrade** tab.
* If your organization exceeds the member limit:
    * Only the 20 most recent developers can view findings from Semgrep scans.
    * Overlimit findings data is retained for three months. When your organization goes below the usage limit, or upgrades to Team or Enterprise, the findings data will be accessible again.
    * You are notified of a 30-day grace period through in-app notifications and emails. After this grace period ends, additional developers (the 21st onwards) will not receive notifications or comments. Findings introduced by additional developers won't be surfaced in Semgrep Cloud Platform.

### Findings, language support, and rules

| Feature  | Semgrep OSS | Semgrep Code Community | Semgrep Code Team |
| -------  | --------- | ------- | -------- |
| **Custom rules** | ✔️ yes | ✔️ yes | ✔️ yes |
| **Community rule registry** | ✔️ yes | ✔️ yes | ✔️  yes  |
| **Editor** | n/a (alternatively, use Playground)  | ✔️ yes | ✔️ yes |
| **Autofix through PR/MR comments** | n/a | ❌ no | ✔️ yes |
| **Custom rule messages** | ✔️  yes (for your custom rules)  |  ✔️  yes (for your custom rules) | ✔️  yes (for any rule) |
| **Semgrep Pro Engine** | n/a | ❌ no | ✔️  yes |
| **Developer feedback** | n/a  | ❌ no | ✔️ yes |
| **Private rules** | n/a | ❌ no | ✔️ yes | 
| **Custom language support** | n/a | ❌ no | ❌ no |
| **Findings retention** | n/a | 1 month | 5 years |

Notes:

* **Custom rules** are rules that you can create and save through either the [Playground](https://semgrep.dev/playground) or the Editor. The Playground and the [Editor](../editor) are online tools where you can write your rule patterns and test them on sample code. You must be signed in to use the Editor.
* Developers can create fixes to their rules through an `autofix` key. For example, when banning outdated libraries, setting an autofix value with the correct library replaces the banned library.
* Semgrep Cloud Platform provides this functionality with **Autofix through PR/MR comments**. These comments appear as suggestions that developers can commit with a single click.
* **Custom rule messages** can be applied to public and private rules.
* **Semgrep Pro Engine** enables interfile tracking within a codebase, keeping track of class and function definitions beyond a single file.
* **Developer feedback** is a means for developers to communicate to security or rule-writing teams about a rule's precision. Discover what rules result in false positives and refine them through this feature.
* **Custom language support** is available for Enterprise tier users.

### Integrations and notifications

| Feature  | Semgrep OSS | Semgrep Code Community | Semgrep Code Team |
| -------  | --------- | ------- | -------- |

## Choosing a Semgrep App tier

Semgrep App has three tiers:

| Tier | Price | Description |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
| **Community** | Free | For individuals and small teams that need the essentials to secure their code. |
| **Team** | US$40 monthly per developer per product | For bigger teams that want to scale their usage and access all features.  |
| **Enterprise** | Custom pricing | For organizations needing custom features, control, and support. |

Semgrep App integrates with a GitHub or GitLab account at either the organizational or individual level. There is no limit to the number of members in an organization for all tiers.

Billing depends on the number of **developers**. Any organization member who has made a commit in a project within the past 30 days is considered a **developer**.

Members who do **not** make any commits on the code do not need to pay for Semgrep and are not billed. Semgrep Team tier features apply to the entire organization, even if not all members are billed.

### Comparing free and paid tier features

#### Organizational management and usage limits

| Feature  | Community | Team | Enterprise |
| -------  | --------- | ------- | -------- |
| **Member limit** | 20 developers | ♾️  unlimited | ♾️  unlimited |
| **Project limit** |♾️  unlimited | ♾️  unlimited | ♾️  unlimited |

Notes:

* Member usage limits are visible in your **[Settings page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings) > Upgrade** tab.
* If your organization exceeds the member limit:
    * Only the 20 most recent developers can view findings from Semgrep scans.
    * Overlimit findings data is retained for three months. When your organization goes below the usage limit, or upgrades to Team or Enterprise, the findings data will be accessible again.
    * You are notified of a 30-day grace period through in-app notifications and emails. After this grace period ends, additional developers (the 21st onwards) will not receive notifications or comments. Findings introduced by additional developers won't be surfaced in Semgrep App.

## Determining your plan needs

### Number of developers

Within your team or organization, assess the number of members that make commits. That determines the number of developers needed for the plan purchase.

For example, if a project has 4 unique developers who create commits during the billing period while Semgrep is scanning their repositories, only 4 developers are required even if the organization has a total of 10 members. If these unique developers commit to many projects within the same organization, they are counted once, so no additional cost is charged.

All members of the organization, regardless of developer status, have access to paid features for the chosen tier. This means that project managers and other non-programming roles can still view the Semgrep Cloud Platform dashboard.

### Plan limits

Should your plan exceed the limit, we will reach out and come up with a new plan that fits your needs.

## Upgrading your plan

To upgrade to the **Team tier** through a **credit card**:

1. In the Settings page, select the Payment tab.
2. Select the number of developers to purchase licenses for.
3. Fill in your payment details.


![Screenshot of payment menu](/img/billing-and-pricing-payment.png)<br />

To upgrade to the **Enterprise tier**, please [contact us](https://semgrep.dev/contact-us).

### Billing

Team tier users who pay through a credit card are charged monthly. Enterprise tier users are charged at an agreed-upon billing cycle. For any concerns such as custom payment methods and billing cycles, send an email to [billing@r2c.dev](mailto:billing@r2c.dev) to get in touch with our sales team.

## Modifying or canceling your plan

To modify or cancel your plan, send an email to [billing@r2c.dev](mailto:billing@r2c.dev).

## Paying for your plan

Pay through the following methods: 

<dl>
<dt>Pay using your credit card.</dt>
<dd>The payment will be processed through Stripe.</dd>
<dt>Pay through a purchase order or invoice.</dt>
