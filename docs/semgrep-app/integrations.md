## Integrating various third-party tools

This section describes how to integrate Semgrep App into particular third-party tools.

### Slack

Integrating with Slack allows Semgrep to send findings to a channel on your Slack workspace.

To set it up, create an app within Slack and enable that app's **Incoming Webhooks** feature. By creating a webhook, you'll have a URL that serves as Semgrep's endpoint to your Slack workspace. Follow the guide below to create the app and webook, and integrate with Semgrep:

1. Log in to your Slack account. Enter your login details in [Slack workspace](https://slack.com/workspace-signin).
2. Create an app in your Slack workspace by following this link: [Slack apps](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1).
3. Select **From scratch** and fill in the fields for your app's name and workspace.

4. You will be redirected to your new app's settings page. Alternatively, you can find this page by viewing your apps [here](https://api.slack.com/apps) and selecting your integration app from the menu.
5. Click on **Incoming Webhooks** on the left menu, and then enable the toggle.
6. After you have enabled **Incoming Webhooks**, follow one of these steps:
    - Generate a **Webhook URL**.
    - Request to add a new webhook from a workspace owner.
7. After you have obtained the Webhook URL, return to Semgrep and create a new Slack integration. Name the integration and copy-paste the URL into the **Slack URL** field. You may opt to select the **Inventory** flag to include notifications about Code Asset Inventory findings.
8. Click **Test**, and then select in which Slack channel you receive notifications.
