# Semgrep Web App API

Semgrep App provides an API that enables you to list deployments, gather findings created by Semgrep App, and list projects. The API documentation uses the **OpenAPI format**. The API requires a [Team or Enterprise tier account](https://semgrep.dev/pricing/), with the subsequent API token provisioned in your settings.

See the API documentation of **[Semgrep Web App](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/)** for full reference documentation.
