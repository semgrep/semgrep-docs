# SSO Configuration

**SSO (single sign-on)** is a **Team/Enterprise tier feature**. Semgrep supports [OAuth2/OIDC](#oauth2oidc) and [SAML 2.0](#saml-20).

## OAuth2/OIDC

OAuth2/OIDC is configured through the **Semgrep App Dashboard**. 

To set up SSO:

1. From the **App Dashboard**, click on **Settings > Configure SSO: OpenID**.
2. Copy the `Provider ID` and `Redirect URI`.

3.Generate a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` through your authentication provider by pasting `Provider ID` and `Redirect URI` values as needed.

4. From your authentication provider, copy the values for `Base URL/Domain` and `Email Domain` to Semgrep's Configure SSO: OpenID tab. `Base URL/Domain` is `Okta domain` for Okta SSO.
5. Provide a descriptive `Display Name`.
