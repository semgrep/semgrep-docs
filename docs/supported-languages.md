# Supported languages

## Language maturity

<SupportedLanguagesTable />

## Support expectations

* **Experimental**: experimental support with many known bugs.
    * Looking for dedicated users to help us improve these languages.
    * Expect limited support responses, as these languages will be lowest priority.
* **Beta**: supported language with known bugs.
    * Looking for beta users to report bugs and rapidly iterate with our team.
    * Expect best-effort support responses when there are no higher priority requests being handled.
* **GA**: production-level support with few known bugs.
    * Looking for bug reports and feedback from users.
    * Expect timely and thorough support responses, generally within 24 hours.

## Maturity definitions

Language maturity is determined by 3 factors in the Semgrep ecosystem:

1. **Parse rate** - how well Semgrep can parse code in a given language.
1. **Feature support** - what [Semgrep features](writing-rules/pattern-syntax.mdx) are implemented for a given language.
1. **Ruleset count** - number of [Semgrep rule groupings](https://semgrep.dev/explore) in the cloud app.

There are 3 levels of maturity: **experimental**, **beta**, and **generally available (GA)**. Each of these maturity levels are combined with a threshold of the factors above. When a language meets the maturity threshold for each of the factors then itâ€™s moved into that maturity level.

Generally speaking, the features-by-maturity level are roughly: **experimental)** syntax support, ellipsis operator support, and basic metavariable support, **beta)** everything prior and nearly complete metavariable support and metavariable equality, **GA)** everything prior and all advanced features like regexp, equivalence, deep expression operator, typing, etc.

The following thresholds define each maturity level:

     semgrep-core/tests/Test.ml and its maturity level regression testing code.
