# Supported languages

This document provides information about supported languages and language maturity definitions for the following products:

* Semgrep Code
* Semgrep OSS
* Semgrep Supply Chain

## Semgrep Code and OSS

Semgrep OSS is a fast, lightweight program analysis tool that can help you detect security issues in your code. It makes use of Semgrep's LGPL 2.1 open source engine.

Semgrep Code is a static application security testing SAST solution that uses both Semgrep OSS Engine and a proprietary Semgrep Pro engine. This engine can perform more complex code analyses, resulting in a higher true positive rate than Semgrep OSS.

Use either tool to scan local code or integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the continuous scanning of your repositories.

| Product | Analysis |
| -------   | ------ |
| [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Semgrep OSS](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep) |<ul><li>Single-function analysis</li><li>Single-file analysis</li></ul> |
| Semgrep Code  |<ul><li>All analyses in the OSS Engine</li><li>Cross-file (interfile) analysis</li><li>Cross-function (interprocedural) analysis</li></ul>   |

### Language maturity levels
Semgrep Code languages can be classified into four maturity levels:

* Generally available (GA)
* Beta
* Experimental
* Community supported\*

\*Community supported languages meet the parse rate and syntax requirements of **Experimental** languages. Users can still access community rules or write their own rules.

Their differences are outlined in the following table:

<table>
    <thead><tr>
        <td><strong>Feature</strong></td>
        <td><strong>GA</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Beta</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Experimental</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Community supported</strong></td>
    </tr></thead>
    <tbody>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Semgrep syntax</td>
        <td>Regex, equivalence, deep expression operators, types and typing. All features supported in Beta.</td>
        <td>Complete metavariable support, metavariable equality. All features supported in Experimental.</td>
        <td colspan="2">Syntax, ellipsis operator, basic metavariable functionality.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Support</td>
        <td>Highest quality support by the Semgrep team. Reported issues are resolved promptly.</td>
        <td>Supported by the Semgrep team. Reported issues are fixed after GA languages.</td>
        <td>There are limitations to this language's functionality. Reported issues are tracked and prioritized with best effort.</td>
        <td>These languages are supported by the Semgrep community. While Semgrep may develop rules or engine updates for these languages, they are not prioritized.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Semgrep Code language support

Semgrep Code supports over 30 languages and counting! ðŸš€

<SupportedLanguagesTable />


### Semgrep OSS language support

**All Semgrep OSS languages are community supported.** Community supported languages must meet the parse rate and syntax requirements of **experimental** support in Semgrep Code to be listed here. Semgrep OSS uses Semgrep's open source engine.

Community supported languages have varying levels of rule coverage - view the registry and filter out Pro rules to see the level of coverage for OSS.

## Semgrep Supply Chain

<SscIntro/>

Semgrep Supply Chain parses **lockfiles** for dependencies, then scans your codebase for reachable findings based on the lockfiles. Some languages, such as Java, have several lockfiles, depending on your repository's package manager. For some languages, such as JavaScript and Python, a manifest file is also parsed to determine [transitivity](/docs/semgrep-supply-chain/glossary/#transitive-or-indirect-dependency).

_*Semgrep Supply Chain scans transitive dependencies for **all supported languages** but does **not** perform reachability analysis on transitive dependencies._ <br />
_**â€¡Reachability support level** refers to the level of support for reachability analysis for the language. At the minimum, Semgrep Supply Chain uses **lockfile-only** rules, which compare a package's version against versions with known vulnerabilities._ <br />
_**â€ â€ **Semgrep Supply Chain supports `requirements.txt` when it is used as a **lockfile**. This means that `requirements.txt` must be set to exact versions (pinned dependencies) and the file must be generated automatically._ <br />
_**Â§** Supply Chain does not analyze the transitivity of packages for these language or lockfile combinations. All dependencies are listed as **Unknown** transitivity._

### Maturity levels

Semgrep Supply Chain has two maturity levels:

* General Availability (GA)
* Beta

Their differences are outlined in the following table:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Feature</strong></td>
   <td><strong>GA</strong></td>
   <td><strong>Beta</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Number of reachability rules</td>
   <td>10+</td>
   <td>1+</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Semgrep, Inc. rule-writing support</td>
   <td>Quickly release new rules for all critical and high vulnerabilities based on the latest <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln">security advisories</a>.</td>
   <td>No commitment for new rules based on the latest security advisories.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Semgrep OSS Engine <a href='/supported-languages#semgrep-oss-language-support'>language support</a></td>
   <td>Semgrep OSS Engine support is GA.</td>
   <td>Semgrep OSS Engine support is at least Beta.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

:::info Feature and product maturity levels
* The detailed specifications previously provided apply only to language support. Language maturity levels differ from feature and product maturity levels.
* Semgrep features and products documented as experimental, beta, or GA generally follow the definitions in a [Software release life cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle).
