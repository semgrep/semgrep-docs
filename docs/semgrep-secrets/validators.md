# Write custom validators

[Semgrep Secrets](/semgrep-secrets/conceptual-overview) uses proprietary **validators** to determine if a secret is
actively being used. Validators are included in the
[rules](/semgrep-secrets/rules) that Semgrep Secrets uses.

This article walks you through the syntax required to write your own custom
validators.


:::note
- The syntax for Semgrep Secrets validators is experimental and subject to change.
- Semgrep currently supports validation using HTTP and HTTPS.
:::

## Sample validator

```yaml
validators:
- http:
    request:
      headers:
        Authorization: Bearer $REGEX
        Host: api.semgrep.dev
        User-Agent: Semgrep
      method: GET
      url: https://api.semgrep.dev/user
    response:
    - match:
      - status-code: 200
      result:
        validity: valid
    - match:
      - status-code: 401
      result:
        validity: invalid
```

## Syntax

### validator

| Key | Required | Description |
| - | - | - |
| validator | Yes | Used to define a list of validators within a Semgrep rule. |

### type

<!-- vale off -->

| Key | Required | Description |
| - | - | - |
| http | Yes | Indicates that the request type is `http`. |

<!-- vale on -->

:::note
Semgrep only supports web services with HTTP(S).
:::

### request

<!-- vale off -->

| Key | Required | Description |
| - | - | - |
| request | Yes | Describes the request object and the URL to which the request object should be sent |
| method | Yes | The HTTP method Semgrep uses to make the call. Accepted values: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`, `PATCH` |
| url | Yes | The URL to which the call is made |
| headers | Yes | The headers to include with the call |
| body | No | The body used with `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests |

<!-- vale on -->

#### Subkeys for `headers`

The following keys are for use with `headers`:

| Key | Required | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Host | No | The host to which the call is made. Only the `url` field is required, but you can override the host if needed  |
| Other-values | No | The request header. Accepts all values, including `Authorization`, `Content-Type`, `User-Agent`, and so on  |

#### Example

```yaml
request:
  headers:
    Authorization: Bearer $REGEX
    Host: api.semgrep.dev
    User-Agent: Semgrep
  method: GET
  url: https://api.semgrep.dev/user
```

### response

The response key is used to determine the validation state. It accepts a list of objects with the Subkeys `match` and `result`.

| Key | Required | Description |
| - | - | - |
| match | Yes | Defines the list of match conditions. |
| result | Yes | Defines the validity. Accepted values: `Valid`, `Invalid` |

#### Subkeys for `match`

Match accepts a list of objects. No specific key is required, but at least one key must be present.

| Key | Description |
| - | - |
| status-code | The HTTP status code expected by Semgrep Secrets for it to consider the secret a match |
| content | The response body; you can inspect it for a specific value to determine if the request is valid. An example of where this is useful is when both invalid and valid responses return the same status code |
| headers | Accepts a list of objects with the keys name/value they must be exact values |


#### Subkeys for `result`

| Key | Required | Description |
| - | - | - |
| validity | Yes | Sets the validity based on the HTTP status code received. Accepted values: `valid` and `invalid` |
| message | No | Used to override the rule message based on the secret's validity state |
| metadata | No | Used to override existing metadata fields or add new metadata fields based on the secret's validity state |
| severity |  No | Used to override the existing rule severity based on the validity state |

#### Subkeys for `content`

| Key | Required | Description |
| - | - | - |
| language | Yes | Indicates the pattern language to use; this must be `regex` or `generic`|
| pattern-regex | Yes | Defines the regex used to search the response body. Alternatively, you can use the `patterns` key and [define patterns as you would for rules](/semgrep-secrets/rules/#subkeys-under-the-patterns-key) |

#### Example

```yaml
response:
- match:
  - status-code: 200
  - content:
      language: regex
      pattern-regex: (\"ok\":true)
    status-code: 200
```

### Base64 encoding

You can use Base64 encoding by leveraging the `__semgrep_internal_encode_64(...)` utility. Base64 encoding can be applied to the following fields:

- `url`
- `body`
- `header` values

:::note
The Base64 encoding of fields is experimental and can change at any time.
