# Scan for secrets

Semgrep Secrets allows you to detect and triage leaked secrets and credentials
and save time by prioritizing which secrets to rotate based on whether they're active and in use.

This document guides you through:

1. Enabling Semgrep Secrets
2. Viewing your results and triaging your findings
3. Setting up PR comments and notifications

## Language and environment support

Semgrep Secrets can scan repositories using **any programming language** and supports the posting of PR and MR comments to GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

## Enable Semgrep Secrets

:::info Prerequisite
You have completed a [Semgrep core deployment](/deployment/core-deployment).
:::

1. Log into [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Click **<i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> Settings**.
3. On the **Deployment** tab, click the **<i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-large-on"></i> Secrets** toggle to enable.

Once you've enabled Secrets for your organization, all Semgrep scans include secret scanning. There are no additional steps to take.

## Scan your repository

After you've enabled Semgrep Secrets, you can:

* Manually trigger a full scan of your repository through your CI provider
* Start a scan from the CLI (Semgrep recommends that you run CLI scans only on feature branches, not main branches)
* Wait for your scheduled Semgrep full scan
* Open a pull request or merge request and wait for Semgrep to scan the branch automatically

## Upgrade your rules

If you're using Semgrep Code rules to identify leaked credentials, you'll see prompts in Semgrep AppSec Platform indicating that there's an improved version that utilizes Semgrep Secrets' feature set, primarily its validators, which can validate whether the detected credential is active, and improvements in detecting and hiding false positives.

You can see individual findings for which there is a Semgrep Secrets rule upgrade in Semgrep AppSec Platform's **Findings** page. The findings are tagged with a label that says `Secrets version available! Click to see rule(s)`.

1. Sign in to Semgrep AppSec Platform.
2. Go to **Rules** > **Policies** > **Code**.
3. Under **Available rule upgrades**, ensure that you've selected **Secrets**.
