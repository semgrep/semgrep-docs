## Enabling Semgrep Secrets

:::info Prerequisites
* Semgrep Secrets can only be enabled through Semgrep Cloud Platform (SCP). [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Create an account](https://semgrep.dev/login) to enable Semgrep Secrets.
* You have added or onboarded at least one repository to Semgrep Cloud Platform for scanning. See Starting a SAST and SCA scan on a remote repository.
:::

1. Contact the Semgrep team by filling out the [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Semgrep Secrets Beta](https://get.semgrep.dev/secrets-beta-request.html) form.
1. When you have received confirmation that Semgrep Secrets has been activated for your account, [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> sign in to Semgrep Cloud Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
1. Click **<i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> Settings**.
1. In the Products section, click the **<i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-large-on"></i> Secrets** toggle.
1. Optional: After enabling Semgrep Secrets, you can trigger a full scan manually through your CI provider or wait for your scheduled Semgrep full scan, typically daily.

## Scanning environments

A scan can be triggered in the following environments:

* You can start a scan **manually** from your CI provider if your CI provider supports running CI jobs on-demand. Refer to your CI provider's documentation for details.
* You can start a scan **from your CLI**. It is recommended to run CLI scans on non-mainline branches, such as feature branches.
* When you **open a PR or MR**, Semgrep automatically scans the branch.

### Scanning for secrets through a CI job

After following the steps in [Enabling Semgrep Secrets](#enabling-semgrep-secrets), all Semgrep scans in your CI jobs include secret scanning. There are no additional steps to take.

After each scan, your findings are displayed in **Semgrep Cloud Platform > Secrets**.

:::caution Troubleshooting
If you do not receive any secrets findings in your scans after enabling Semgrep Secrets, check the following:

* Check the job's log in your CI provider.
    * Search for the following line or similar to ensure that a secrets scan was included as part of the scan: `Enabled products: Semgrep Code, Semgrep Supply Chain, Semgrep Secrets`
    * If the log does not include the line, your CI job may be running an out-of-date Semgrep version or the wrong semgrep command. Ensure that your Docker image or custom runner is up-to-date, and ensure that you are running `semgrep ci`.
* Feel free to contact [<i class="fa-regular fa-envelope"></i> support@semgrep.com](mailto:support@semgrep.com) for additional assistance.
* If a secrets scan ran successfully, it is unlikely but possible that there are no findings.
:::

### Scanning for secrets in your local development machine (CLI)

:::info Prerequisites
* An up-to-date installation of the Semgrep CLI tool. Semgrep Secrets does not work on older versions of Semgrep. See [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Getting started](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/#installing-and-running-semgrep-locally).
* An existing Semgrep Cloud Platform account.
* An existing Semgrep organization.
* Semgrep Secrets must be enabled in Semgrep Cloud Platform.
:::

You can scan for secrets from your local development machine by using the Semgrep CLI tool. 

1. Ensure you are logged in to Semgrep:
```
semgrep login
```
2. Run a scan:
```
semgrep ci
```
3. Once the scan has completed, you can view that repository's findings in Semgrep Cloud Platform by logging in then clicking **Projects**, then the number of Secrets findings under <span className="placeholder">REPOSITORY_NAME</span>. <br />
![The number of Secrets findings can be seen in the Projects page.](/img/secrets-projects.png#md-width)

Findings from local scans are differentiated from their remote counterparts through their slugs. Remote repositories are identified as <span className="placeholder">  ACCOUNT_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME</span>, while local repositories are identified as <span className="placeholder">REPOSITORY_NAME</span>.

## Receiving findings in GitHub through PR comments

This section describes how to set up PR or MR comments from Semgrep. 

:::info
After enabling this feature, only **valid** (active) secrets-related findings leave a PR or MR comment.
:::

## Triaging secrets in Semgrep Cloud Platform

Triage secrets-related findings in the Secrets page. By default, all findings are displayed. A common triage workflow includes the following tasks:

1. Filtering for a particular characteristic of a finding, such as its **Validation status**, its **Repository or Branch**, or its **Type**.
2. Analyzing if the findings are true or false positives.
3. Applying a **triage state** to the filtered findings based on the analysis in step 2.
    1. Setting a finding as **Ignored** means that no action is undertaken and the finding is closed. Subsequent scans won't include this finding.
    1. Setting or retaining a finding as **Open** means that the finding is a true positive and needs to be fixed or resolved.
        1. Optional: You can create a ticket for **Linear, Jira, or Asana** to assign a developer to fix **Open** findings.
4. When commits are added to the PR or MR, Semgrep re-scans the PR or MR and detects if a finding is fixed. The finding is resolved automatically upon scanning. Users do not need to set a finding as **Fixed** manually.

### Common filtering use cases

Find and perform bulk operations through filtering. Perform all filter operations in the **Secrets** page.

| Task | Steps |
| ---- | ----- |
| Viewing valid findings | Under **Validation**, click **⚠️Confirmed valid**. |
| View findings in a specific project or branch |1. Under **Projects**, select a repository from the drop-down menu. <br /> 2. Under **Branches**, select a branch from the drop-down menu. |
| View findings of a specific type of secret, such as **personal token** or **password**. | Under **Type**, select a type of secret.
| View findings of a specific severity | Under **Severity**, select a value. |

![Secrets page and relevant triaging elements.](/img/secrets-triage.png#bordered)
**_Figure._** Secrets page and relevant triaging elements: (a) All available filters; (b) Bulk selection toggle; (c) Bulk triage button.

Triage findings in bulk by performing the following steps:

1. Begin by ensuring that you display all **Open** findings.
2. Apply filters with as much specificity as possible. You may have to perform bulk triage several times. By starting with the most specific cases, and closing the findings from those specific cases, you are able to narrow down findings as you work from specific to broad filter criteria.
3. Click the bulk select check box.
4. Click **Triage**, then your selected triage state, typically **Ignore**.
5. Optional: Repeat this procedure to triage all open findings.

## Further customization 

* Create tickets in Jira, Linear, or Asana for secrets-related findings. See [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Ticketing](semgrep-cloud-platform/ticketing/).
* See [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Secrets API documentation](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/#tag/SecretsService).

## Appendix: Semgrep Secrets filters

This section describes what filters are available to quickly sort through findings and perform operations on filtered findings.

### Triage status

| Status | Description |
| -----------  | ------------ |
| **Open** | Findings are open by default. A finding is open if it was present the last time Semgrep scanned the code and it has not been ignored. An open finding represents a match between the code and a rule that is enabled in the repository. Open findings require action, such as rewriting the code to eliminate the detected vulnerability. |
| **Ignored** | Findings that are ignored are present in the code, but have been labeled as unimportant. Ignore findings that are false positives or deprioritized issues. |
| **Fixed** | Fixed findings were detected in a previous scan, but are no longer detected in the most recent scan of that same branch. |

### Severity

Severity is assigned based on how sensitive or crucial the exposed web service is. Possible values include:

* High
* Medium
* Low

### Validation

Refers to whether or not a secret is active and can be used to grant resources or authentication, or if a secret is inactive.

| Validation | Description |
| -----------  | ------------ |
| Confirmed valid | Semgrep made an API call using the secret and it returned an HTTP response of 200 or similar and granted authentication. |
| Confirmed invalid | Semgrep made an API call using the secret and it returned an HTTP response of 403 or similar. |
| Validation error | Semgrep made an API call but it returned and HTTP response of 400 or similar; a server error, such as a timeout, occurred. The Semgrep Team recommends manually reviewing the finding. |
| No validator | Semgrep does not perform any validation on this finding. You must manually review the finding. |

### Repository visibility

Refers to whether or not the repository is a public repository or private. This is detected through your source code manager.

:::info
Semgrep supports visibility detection only for GitHub repositories of any plan.
:::

| Repository visibility | Description | 
| -----------  | ------------ |
| Public | Repository access doesn't require authentication; at a minimum, it can be viewed by anyone. |
| Private | Repository access requires authentication. |
| Unknown | Semgrep Secrets is unable to detect your repository visibility. This is typically assigned to: <ul><li>Scans from local developer machines.</li><li>Scans from any non-GitHub source code manager, such as GitLab.</li></ul> |

### Type

Refers to the type of secret, such as **Private key**, or web service that makes use of the secret, such as Sendgrid or Stripe.

### Project

A repository that's been onboarded to Semgrep for scanning.

### Branch

A branch of any Project.
