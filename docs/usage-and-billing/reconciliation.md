# Additional usage and reconciliation of licenses

If your organization uses more licenses than purchased for the contract period, you will be charged for each extra license starting the month after the overage.

Contact your Semgrep Account Executive every **60 days** if you need more licenses than initially purchased.

## Example of license reconciliation

On January 21, you purchased annual licenses of Semgrep Supply Chain’s Team tier for 50 developers. The 21st of the month is the start date of the annual contract. The contract started that day. On February 28, you used 70 licenses, exceeding your original purchase by 20. This requires a contract adjustment.

Contract adjustment:

- Because the organization’s usage exceeded the allocated licenses on February 28, March 21 is designated as the adjustment date in accordance with contract terms and reflects the 10 months remaining in the contract.
- * The extra charge is the cost per developer multiplied by 10 months and 20 users.
