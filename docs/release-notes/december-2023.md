    1.54.1](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/tag/v1.54.1)

## üåê Cloud Platform

### Added

* Semgrep IDE integrations now cache information about the repository so that it
  does not traverse the entire repository on every scan to determine if the
  files are valid targets for scanning; this improves scan times.
* Users can now ignore findings locally in Semgrep IDE Extensions. These changes
  persist between restarts.
* The metrics collected now include more granular information to help
differentiate scans using different engine capabilities, such as intraprocedural
scans without secrets validation versus intraprocedural scans *with* secrets
validation.
* **CLI tool**: Added new `semgrep test` subcommand, which is an alias for
`semgrep scan --test`. **Note**: When running Semgrep on a test directory, use
`semgrep scan test` to avoid confusion with the new `semgrep test` subcommand.

### Changed

* Fixed issue where empty tables in `pyproject.toml` files would fail to parse.
* **OCaml**: Switched to a tree-sitter-based parser instead of the Menhir
  parser.
* **Rust**: Updated the parser used for Rust.

### Fixed

* Fixed issue where webhooks stopped working.
* Fixed issue so that clicking **Start Tour** now restarts the Getting Started
  tutorial.
* Fixed issue where the **Members** page doesn't display a user's new role until
  the page reloads. <!--OS-1233-->
* Fixed issue where users switching organizations would result in a 404.
  <!--OS-136-->
* Fixed the **Connect to** button under **Settings** > **Source Code Managers**
  so that it displays correctly based on whether the user can connect to a
  source code manager. <!-- https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-app/pull/11812
  -->
* **CLI tool**: Updated CLI error message to clarify that users should log in
  before running either:
  * `semgrep ci`
  * `semgrep scan` then `semgrep scan --config`
  
## üíª Code

### Fixed

* Fixed issue where Semgrep Code findings marked as **fixed** can be triaged via
  the rule group. If the rule is fixed, the triage status cannot be changed back
  to **ignored**.
  <!--FIND-1453-->
* Fixed issue where the rule information card and the rule preview are missing
  for older findings; all findings now display this information.
  <!--FIND-1433-->
* Fixed issue where the finding's severity displayed doesn't match the rule's
  severity once the rule has been updated. <!--FIND-1397-->

## ü§ñ Assistant (beta)

### Added

* Added the **Analyze** button, which triggers all Assistant functions,
including autofix, autotriage, and component tagging, on selected findings.
After Assistant performs these functions, users can see their results if they
filter for findings based on **Recommendation** or by **Component**.
Additionally, users that choose **No Grouping** instead of **Group by Rule** see
false positive and true positive recommendations when viewing their finding
details pages. 

## üîê Secrets (beta)

### Added

* Added support for custom validator rules. Note that custom validator rules are
  private and can't be shared to Semgrep Registry.

### Fixed

* Fixed issue where the **Ignore** button doesn't work when triaging Secrets.
  <!--SCRT-283-->

## üìù Documentation and knowledge base

### Added

* Added [Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart/).
* Added [Privacy and legal considerations](/docs/semgrep-code/semgrep-assistant-code#privacy-and-legal-considerations) information for Semgrep Assistant.
* New knowledge base articles:
  * [Fix pattern parse errors when running rules](/docs/kb/rules/pattern-parse-error)
  * [How to scan a large monorepo](/docs/kb/semgrep-code/scanning-large-monorepo)
  * [Scanning a monorepo in parts](/kb/semgrep-ci/scan-monorepo-in-parts)
  * [SSO Error: Signature validation failed. SAML Response rejected](/docs/kb/semgrep-cloud-platform/saml-bad-signature)
  * [Troubleshooting "You are seeing this because the engine was killed" on monorepos](/docs/kb/semgrep-code/scan-engine-kill)

### Changed

* Updated overview articles for [Semgrep Code](/semgrep-code/overview/) and
  [Semgrep Supply Chain](/docs/semgrep-supply-chain/overview/).
* Updated documentation on setting up pull request or merge request comments for
  [GitHub](/docs/semgrep-cloud-platform/github-pr-comments/),
  [GitLab](/docs/semgrep-cloud-platform/gitlab-mr-comments/), and
  [Bitbucket](/docs/semgrep-cloud-platform/bitbucket-pr-comments/) users.
* General improvements to API docs, including clarification of usage
  instructions for Supply Chain and Secrets endpoints.

### Fixed

* Minor corrections and updates to various articles.
