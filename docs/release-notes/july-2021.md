# July 2021

## Version 0.60.0

### Additions

- Detect duplicate keys in YAML dictionaries in Semgrep rules when parsing a rule (for example detect multiple metavariable inside one metavariable-regex).

### Fixes

C/C++: Fixed stack overflows (segmentation faults) when processing very large files ([#3538](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3538))

- JavaScript: Fixed stack overflows (segmentation faults) when processing very large files ([#3538](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3538))
- JavaScript: Detect numeric object keys 1 and 0x1 as equal ([#3579](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3579))
- OCaml: improved parsing stats by using tree-sitter-ocaml (from 25% to 88%)
- taint-mode: Check nested functions
- taint-mode: foo.x is now detected as tainted if foo is a source of taint
- taint-mode: Do not crash when it is not possible to compute range info
- Rust: recognize ellipsis in macro calls patterns ([#3600](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3600))
- Ruby: correctly represent a.(b) in the AST ([#3603](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3603))

### Changes

- Added precise error location for the Semgrep metachecker, for example to detect duplicate patterns in a rule.

## Version 0.58.2

### Additions

- New iteration of taint-mode that allows to specify sources/sanitizers/sinks using arbitrary pattern formulas. This provides plenty of flexibility. Note that we breaks compatibility with the previous taint-mode format, e.g., - source(...) must now be written as - pattern: source(...).
- Experimental support for HTML. This does not rely on the generic mode but instead parses the HTML using tree-sitter-html. This allows some semantic matching (e.g., matching attributes in any order).
- js alpha support ([#1751](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/1751))
- New matching option implicit_ellipsis that allows disabling the implicit ... that are added to record patterns, plus allow matching "spread fields" (JS ...x) at any position ([#3120](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3120))
- Support globstar (**) syntax in path include/exclude ([#3173](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3173))

### Fixes

- Apple M1: Semgrep installed from Homebrew no longer hangs ([#2432](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/2432))
- Ruby command shells are distinguished from strings ([#3343](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3343))
- Java varargs are now correctly matched ([#3455](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3455))
- Support for partial statements (e.g., try { ... }) for Java ([#3417](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3417))
- Java generics are now correctly stored in the AST ([#3505](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3505))
- Constant propagation now works inside Python with statements ([#3402](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3402))
- Metavariable value replacement in message/autofix no longer mixes up short and long names like $X vs $X2 ([#3458](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3458))
- Fixed metavariable name collision during interpolation of message / autofix ([#3483](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3483)) Thanks to[@Justin Timmons](https://r2c-community.slack.com/team/U026SUZKJ8Z) for the fix!
- Revert pattern: $X optimization ([#3476](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3476))
- metavariable-pattern: Allow filtering using a single pattern or pattern-regex
- Dataflow: Translate call chains into IL

### Changes

- Significant speed improvements (noted above)
- The size of the semgrep-core the binary is now 95 MB (was 170 MB in v0.58.0) and a smaller Docker image (from 95 MB to 40 MB)
- The --debug option now displays which files are currently processed incrementally; it will not wait until semgrep-core completely finishes.
- Switch from OCaml 4.10.0 to OCaml 4.12.0
- Faster matching times for generic mode

- Better error message when rule contains empty pattern
