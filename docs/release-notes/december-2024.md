# Semgrep release notes for December 2024

:::info Important changes
- The Semgrep CLI tool requires a minimum version of **Python 3.9** as of Semgrep 1.100.0.
- Semgrep OSS is now **Semgrep Community Edition (CE)**. Read the [Semgrep CE section](#-semgrep-community-edition-ce) for more details.
:::

## üåê Semgrep AppSec Platform

### Added

- **Policy management API** is now in private beta. This API enables you to add, update, and turn off rules for selected policies in your chosen mode.
- You can now export your findings in CSV format. Semgrep can export up to 10,000 most recent findings. For findings greater than 10,000, use the [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> API](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/). See [Export findings](/semgrep-code/findings#export-findings) for more information.

- Semgrep now tracks individual fields or keys in record or dict expressions. For example:
  ```python
  def foo():
      return { 0: "safe", 1: taint }
  
  def test():
      t = foo()
      sink(t[0]) # safe; this is not a finding
      sink(t[1]) # this produces a finding
  ```
- **TypeScript**: Semgrep now supports ellipses in function parameters. For
example, the following code is TypeScript, as opposed to pure JavaScript, because it uses decorators on function parameters:
  ```typescript
  foo(x, @Bar() y, z): string { return ''; }
  ```
  - You can match this method using the following pattern:
  ```typescript
  function $FN(..., @Bar(...) $X, ...) { ... }
  ```
- C#: Patterns such as new `$T(...)` now matches C# target-typed new expressions such as `new ()`.

### Changed

- **Semgrep Managed Scans**: Cloning repositories is now faster. This improves the speed of the overall scan.
- **Reporting**: In cases where there were **no new findings** for the selected time period, the **Guardrails adoption** chart displayed 0% adoption, which was incorrect because there was nothing to adopt as there were no new findings. To better display that there is no data on adoption, the reporting page now displays blocks of grey for periods where there are no findings.

### Removed

- Removed the `use-osemgrep-sarif` flag.

## üíª Semgrep Code

### Added

- Added new **Pro rules**:
  - 4 new rules for **Express.js** that cover SQL injection, object injection, and misconfiguration vulnerabilities.
  - 13 new rules for **NestJS** framework vulnerabilities that cover code injection, SQL injection, path traversal, log injection, XML external entity, and cross site scripting.

### Fixed

<!-- vale off -->
- Fixed the date format used in `--gitlab-sast` option to match the specification and not use RFC 3339. Thanks to Elias Haeussler for the fix.
- Fixed what is considered a sink when a sink formula matches a lambda expression: it is the lambda itself that is the sink, not the individual statements in the lambda.
<!-- vale on -->

## ‚õìÔ∏è Semgrep Supply Chain

### Added

- Semgrep now supports reachability for **Swift**. For CLI users, ensure that you are using Semgrep **1.98.0 or higher**. Swift is the tenth language Semgrep supports with reachability analysis.
  - Added support for SwiftPM `Package.resolved` version 3.
- **Dependency Path**, which displays how transitive dependencies are imported into your code, is now in public beta for Java Gradle and Maven package managers.
  - Dependency Path for Kotlin is in private beta.
  - To join this beta, contact [<i class="fa-regular fa-envelope"></i> support@semgrep.com](mailto:support@semgrep.com).
- Semgrep can now scan your Java Gradle and Maven codebases without the need for a lockfile. This feature is in public beta for Java and private beta for Kotlin Gradle and Maven. See also [Scan a project without lockfiles](/semgrep-supply-chain/getting-started#scan-a-project-without-lockfiles-beta).
  - To participate in this beta, contact [<i class="fa-regular fa-envelope"></i> support@semgrep.com](mailto:support@semgrep.com).
  - Semgrep now provides the flag `--allow-local-builds`, which is used to enable this feature.

### Changed

- Improved `pnpm-lock.yaml` parsing.

## ü§ñ Semgrep Assistant 

### Changed

- Semgrep Assistant is in the process of integrating its remediation guidelines into a single PR or MR comment. This means that you receive only one comment per finding, not including summary comments.
  - Previously, Semgrep Assistant would add an additional, separate comment on the thread after the first comment from Semgrep. With this change, **all Semgrep guidance** is in one comment for clarity.
  - This change is rolling out over the course of several weeks.

## üìù Documentation and knowledge base

### Added

- Added the following new documents, articles and sections:
  - [JSON and SARIF reference](/semgrep-appsec-platform/json-and-sarif) provides you with a list of fields supported by Semgrep CE and Semgrep AppSec Platform.
  - [Full and diff-aware scans with GitHub and Jenkins](/kb/semgrep-ci/jenkins-diff-scans) helps you set up and troubleshoot Semgrep.
  - The [Semgrep Supply Chain > Dependency graphs](/semgrep-supply-chain/dependency-search#dependency-paths-beta) section provides instructions on how to enable the feature.
  - Instructions on [scanning a project without lockfiles](/semgrep-supply-chain/getting-started#scan-a-project-without-lockfiles-beta) in Semgrep Supply Chain. 

### Changed

- Updated Quickstart links to point users to the most common methods of setting up Semgrep.
- Updated language support details in [Supported languages > Semgrep Supply Chain](/supported-languages#semgrep-supply-chain).
- **Extract mode** has been moved to the [Deprecated experiments](/writing-rules/experiments/deprecated-experiments) page.
- Updated Semgrep Secrets triage documentation to include new ticketing integrations and triage states.
- Renamed instances of Semgrep OSS to Semgrep CE, except for instances within release notes.

## üîß Semgrep Community Edition (CE)

- Semgrep OSS has been renamed to **Semgrep Community Edition (CE)**. Semgrep CE remains free, with 2800+ rules and no login required.

- As of Semgrep 1.100.0, certain JSON and SARIF export fields are available only for logged-in users. See the [JSON and SARIF reference](/semgrep-appsec-platform/json-and-sarif) for the list of fields.
