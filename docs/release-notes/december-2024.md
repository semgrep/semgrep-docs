## ‚õìÔ∏è Semgrep Supply Chain

### Added

- **Dependency Path**, which displays how transitive dependencies are imported into your code, is now in public beta for Java Gradle and Maven package managers.
  - Dependency Path for Kotlin is in private beta.
  - To join in this beta, contact [<i class="fa-regular fa-envelope"></i> support@semgrep.com](mailto:support@semgrep.com).
- Semgrep can now scan your Java Gradle and Maven codebases without the need for a lockfile. This feature is in public beta for Java and private beta for Kotlin Gradle and Maven.

## ü§ñ Semgrep Assistant 

### Changed

- Semgrep Assistant is in the process of integrating its remediation guidelines into a single PR or MR comment. This means that you receive only one comment per finding, not including summary comments.
  - Previously, Semgrep Assistant would add an additional, separate comment on the thread after the first comment from Semgrep. With this change, **all Semgrep guidance** is in one comment for clarity.
  - This change is rolling out over the course of several weeks.
