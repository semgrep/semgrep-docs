## üåê Cloud Platform

### Added

- The **Add to policy** button in the **Playground** can now differentiate between custom Code and Secrets rules. When you click **Add to policy**, it detects which type of rule you have written and adds the rule to the corresponding policy board. <!-- 12739 -->

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in which users couldn't claim a license if they only had one organization. <!-- 13076 -->
- **Visual Studio Code extension:** fixed an issue where rules weren't downloaded to the user's machine, which resulted in no findings detected.
- Minor UI and in-app copy fixes in the following:
    - Editor
    - Settings page
    - Tutorial page
    - Onboarding process <!-- 13447, 13445, 13364, 13194, 13082 -->
- Fixed a bug in which users were sometimes unable to delete their SSO configuration. <!-- 13171 -->

## üíª Code

### Added

- Added support for Python's `yield` keyword, enabling the detection of taint findings from taint sources returned by `yield`.
- Added ability for users to copy file paths displayed in Semgrep Cloud Platform's **Findings** page if they aren't links.
- Added the ability for users to see if there's a version of a rule they're currently using that supports interfile analysis.
- Added **Clear filters** button when no findings appear in the **Findings** page after the user has set some filters.
- **API**: added ability to get rules metadata from the API.

### Changed

- Code analysis started by logged-in users running `semgrep ci` now includes cross-function (intrafile) analysis by default. This change affects CI jobs and CLI scans.
- `.phtml` files are now processed as PHP files and analyzed using PHP rules.
- Updated PR comments to include links to specific findings in Semgrep Cloud Platform.
- Users can see all projects, even if they don't have any identified findings, in the **Most findings** list on Semgrep Cloud Platform's **Dashboard** page. <!-- https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-app/pull/12870 -->
- Semgrep Code now distinguishes between findings **resolved by rule changes** and findings **resolved due to code modifications**. This change applies only to new findings.
  - Only findings fixed due to **code modifications** are marked as **fixed**.
    - The fix rate calculated by Semgrep Code now includes only such findings.
  - Findings fixed due to rule changes are marked as **resolved**.
- **CLI**: Semgrep clones the repository into the current working directory instead of a `tmp` folder when using the `--remote` flag.

### Fixed

- **Kotlin**: Fixed a parsing error when a newline appears between the class name and the primary constructor.
- Fixed an issue where autofix on variable definitions could not handle semicolons for Java, C++, C#, Rust, Cairo, Solidity, and Dart.
- Fixed an issue with autofix application on lines with multi-byte characters.
- Fixed issue where credentials were inadvertently included in a project URL when publishing a custom rule using `semgrep publish`. Running `semgrep publish` generates a `rule-origin-note`, which includes the project URL in the metadata. When this process occurs in a GitLab CI job, GitLab includes the CI job tokens in the project URL. Semgrep now removes the credential from the metadata.
- Fixed an issue where reachability rules were deleted from Semgrep Registry.
- Fixed an issue where the timestamp on the findings didn't correspond to the timestamp used by the filter; now, both use the `relevant_since` filter, which provides information about when findings were last reopened.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Supply Chain

### Added

- Supply Chain now offers [lockfile-only support](/supported-languages/#semgrep-supply-chain) for Swift projects.

### Changed

- Findings with a **critical** severity now display in Semgrep Cloud Platform with a darker red color to help distinguish them from high-severity findings.
- Findings are now displayed in Semgrep Cloud Platform with readable names, such as `git-url-parse: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity` instead of `lodash.defaultsdeep: Improper Input Validation`.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where bulk triage didn't work in Semgrep Cloud Platform for Supply Chain findings.
- Fixed an issue where Supply Chain rules and findings erroneously display a confidence label.

## ü§ñ Assistant

Semgrep Assistant is **now generally available (GA)**. Read [the docs](/semgrep-assistant/overview/) and the [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> blog post](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2024/assistant-ga-launch).

### Added

- Added the **Agree** and **Ignore** buttons to the **No grouping** view in the **Semgrep Cloud Platform > Code** page.
- Added the AI **component tags** in the **Finding details** page and **No grouping** view. <!-- 13419 -->
- Added the ability to use AI to generate Semgrep rules (beta). To try this feature:
    1. Navigate to the [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Editor](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/editor) and click on the **<span style={{color:'#ffffff'}}><span style={{backgroundColor:'#000000'}}><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-plus"></i></span></span> black square with white circle plus sign**.
    2. Select **...with Semgrep Assistant (beta)** from the drop-down box.

### Changed

- Improvements to in-app copy and UI. <!-- 13399, 13352 -->

## üîê Secrets

### Added

- Historical scanning is now available as a **public beta** feature. [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Historical scanning](/docs/semgrep-secrets/historical-scanning/) allows users to find valid secrets in their Git commit history. To enable this feature:
    1. Log in to Semgrep Cloud Platform.
    2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Deployments**.
    3. Under **Secrets**, toggle on **Historical scanning**.
  Users can also include the `--historical-secrets` flag when running `semgrep ci` in the CLI.
- Added the ability to view a Secrets rule if there's one that supersedes a Semgrep Code rule with similar functionality. These notifications are available in Semgrep Cloud Platform on:
  - The **Findings** and **Finding Details** pages
  - The **Policies** page
  In addition to the affected findings labeled with **Secrets version available**, users can look for findings using the **Available rule upgrades** filter.

### Changed

- Moved the **Settings** page for Secrets from its **Findings** page to **Settings** > **Deployment**.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where some Secrets findings were labeled as Code findings.
- **CLI**: Fixed an issue where there were no warnings if Secrets is enabled, but users have no Secrets rules configured.

## üìù Documentation and knowledge base

### Added

- Added the following new documents:
    - [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Packages in the Semgrep Docker image](/semgrep-ci/packages-in-semgrep-docker/): Lists the packages including in the Semgrep docker image in addition to the Semgrep binary.
    - [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Semgrep OSS in CI](/docs/deployment/oss-deployment/): A guide to using only open source Semgrep in your CI jobs.
- New Knowledge base article: [Generate lockfiles for Semgrep Supply Chain in a Circle CI pipeline](/kb/semgrep-supply-chain/ssc-lockfiles-circleci).
- Added information on [installing and using the Semgrep App for GitHub Enterprise](/deployment/connect-scm/#github-enterprise-server) to connect to your GitHub orgs.

### Changed

- Major edits and updates to documentation for:
  - [Semgrep Secrets](/semgrep-secrets/getting-started)
  - [Semgrep Assistant](/semgrep-assistant/overview)
  - [Semgrep extension for Visual Studio Code](/extensions/semgrep-vs-code)
- Updated Semgrep Pro Engine documentation to clarify what is enabled by the **cross-file analysis** toggle in **Semgrep Cloud Platform > Settings**.
- Updated [**Findings** page information](/semgrep-code/findings).
- Updated SSO documentation with latest steps to integrate with [Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/deployment/sso/#set-up-saml-sso-with-microsoft-entra-id).
- GitHub Actions configuration snippets have been updated to use `actions/checkout@v4`.
