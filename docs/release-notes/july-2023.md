# July 2023 release notes


## Semgrep OSS Engine

This section of release notes includes upgrades of Semgrep OSS Engine for versions ranging between **1.31.0** and **1.33.2**.

### Added

* Rust: Added support for ellipsis patterns in attribute argument positions. For example, `#[get(...)]`. ([#8148](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/8234))
* Promql: Initial language support. ([#8281](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/8281))
* `.h` files now run when C or C++ are selected as the language.
* `.cjs` and `.mjs` files now run when JavaScript is selected as the language. 
* Taint analysis: Parameters to functions in languages with pattern matching in function arguments, such as Rust and OCaml, now transmit taint when they are sources. This works with nested patterns too. For example, in Rust:
    ```rust
    fn f ((x, (y, z)): t) {
      let x = 2;
    }
    ```
    Tainting the sole argument to this function results in all of the identifiers `x`, `y`, and `z` now being tainted. ([#8216](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/8216))
* Added rule option `interfile: true`, which is set under the `options` key. This rule option replaces setting interfile under metadata. Metadata is not meant to have any effect on how a rule is run. (pro-94)
Changed
Updated semgrep-interfaces, changed api_scans_findings to ci_scan_results, removed gitlab_token field and added ignores and renamed_paths field to ci_scan_results. (app-4252)
Fixed
Dockerfile language support: String matching is now done by contents, treating the strings foo, 'foo', or "foo" as equal. (gh-8229)

Fixed error where we were not filtering the logging of a new third party library. (gh-8310)

Julia: Fixed a bug where try-catch patterns would not match properly. Now, you can use an empty try-catch pattern, such as:

try
  ...
catch
  ...
end
to catch only Julia code which does not specify an identifier for the catch.

Otherwise, if you want to match any kind of try-catch, you can specify an ellipsis for the catch identifier instead:

try
  ...
catch ...
  ...
end
and this will match any try-catch, including those that do not specify an identifier for the catch. It is strictly more general than the previous. (pa-2918)

Rust: Fixed an issue where implicit returns did not allow taint to flow, and various other small translation issues that would affect taint. (pa-2936)

Fixed bug in gradle.lockfile parser where we would error on empty= with nothing after it (sc-987)
