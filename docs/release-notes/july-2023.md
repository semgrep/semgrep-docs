# July 2023 release notes


## Semgrep OSS Engine

This section of release notes includes upgrades of Semgrep OSS Engine for versions ranging between **1.31.0** and **1.33.2**.

### Added

* Added rule option `interfile: true`, which is set under the `options` key. This rule option replaces setting interfile under the `metadata` key. 
* Docker: Created a `semgrep` user in for the official Semgrep docker container so that people can run it as a non-root user (gh-8116)
* Promql: Initial language support. ([#8281](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/8281))
* `.h` files now run when C or C++ are selected as the language.
* `.cjs` and `.mjs` files now run when JavaScript is selected as the language. 
* Rule syntax: Added metavariable type extension for Semgrep Rule Syntax 2.0 (also known as Experimental Semgrep Syntax). This addition introduces recent changes in Semgrep rule syntax 1.0 to the experimental syntax as well. ([#8183](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/8183))
    ```yaml
    # previous rule syntax 2.0
    rules:
      - id: no-string-eqeq
        message: find errors
        severity: WARNING
        languages:
          - java
        match:
          all:
            - not: null == (String $Y)
            - $X == (String $Y)
    ```
    ```yaml
   # new additions to rule syntax 2.0 (experimental syntax)
    rules:
      - id: no-string-eqeq
        message: find errors
        severity: WARNING
        languages:
          - java
        match:
          all:
            - not: null == $Y
            - $X == $Y
          where:
            - metavariable: $Y
              type: String 
    ```
* Taint analysis: Parameters to functions in languages with pattern matching in function arguments, such as Rust and OCaml, now transmit taint when they are sources. This works with nested patterns too. For example, in Rust:
    ```rust
    fn f ((x, (y, z)): t) {
      let x = 2;
    }
    ```
    Tainting the sole argument to this function results in all of the identifiers `x`, `y`, and `z` now being tainted. ([#8216](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/8216))
* Rust: Added support for ellipsis patterns in attribute argument positions. For example, `#[get(...)]`. ([#8148](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/8234))
* Rust: Added typed metavariable support for Rust (). Users can create `TypedMetavar` using Rust's type annotation syntax `:`. For example, the following rule works for matching `HttpResponseBuilder` type of variables:
    ```yaml
    rules:
    - id: no-direct-response-write
      patterns:
      - pattern: '($BUILDER : HttpResponseBuilder).body(...)'
      - pattern-not: '($BUILDER : HttpResponseBuilder).body("...".to_string())'
      message: find dangerous codes
      severity: WARNING
      languages: [rust]
    ```
* Rust: Added the ability to taint macro calls through its arguments, in macro calls with multiple arguments. (#[8209](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/8209))

### Fixed

- Dockerfile language support: String matching is now done by contents, treating the strings `foo`, `'foo'`, or `"foo"` as equal. ([#8229](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/8229))
- Julia: Fixed a bug where try-catch patterns would not match properly. Now, you can use an empty try-catch pattern, such as:
    ```julia
    try
      ...
    catch
      ...
    end
    ```
    to catch only Julia code which does not specify an identifier for the catch.
    - Otherwise, if you want to match any kind of try-catch, you can specify an ellipsis for the catch identifier instead:
    ```julia
    try
      ...
    catch ...
      ...
    end
    ```
    and this matches any try-catch, including those that do not specify an identifier for the catch. It is strictly more general than the previous.
- Rust: Fixed an issue where implicit returns did not allow taint to flow, and various other small translation issues that would affect taint. ([#8325](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/8325))
- TypeScript and JavaScript: Fixed an issue leading to incorrect autofix results involving JS/TS async arrow functions, for example, `async () => {}` ([#7353](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/7353))
- Dockerfile: Single-quoted strings are now parsed without an error. ([#7780](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/7780))
- Go: Fixed issue with patterns such as:
    - `make(...);` 
    - `make(...,$X);` 
    - `make($A,$B)` ([#8171](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/8171))
- Rust: Fixed attribute patterns to allow matching on simple attribute syntax. ([#8234](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/8234))
- Rust: Fixed a bug where standalone metavariable patterns were not matching as expected. ([#8206](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/8206)) 
- Fixed Python Semgrep pattern parsing to also parse match statements, by chaining in the Python tree-sitter parser, and adding metavariable support to the Python tree-sitter parser.

## Semgrep Cloud Platform

- Various bugfixes and improvements.

## Semgrep Code

### Added

- Added **open findings** column to the Policies page. This column displays the count of open findings for each rule in your Policies. With this column, you can quickly see which rules are producing the most or least amount of findings.
- Added **fix rate** column to the Policies page. This column displays a percentage of resolved fixes associated with the rule, or  "-" if there are no findings for that rule.

### Changed

- Policies page: Rules are now sorted by mode, then by custom rules, then by Semgrep Pro rules, then by Community rules.


### Removed

- The Rule board has been deprecated and removed. The [Policies page](/semgrep-code/policies) is now the default and sole page for rule management in Semgrep Cloud Platform.

## Semgrep Assistant

### Added

- Semgrep Assistant is now in public beta. To try it out, see [Enabling Semgrep Assistant](/semgrep-code/semgrep-assistant-code/#enabling-semgrep-assistant).

## Documentation and knowledge base updates

### Added

* Created a new section on setting up SSC scans for various

## Semgrep Supply Chain

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in `gradle.lockfile` parser where Semgrep Supply Chain previously threw errors on `empty=` with nothing after it.
- `poetry.lock` parsing: Semgrep Supply Chain now correctly handles empty `toml` tables, quoted table keys, and arbitrarily placed comments.
