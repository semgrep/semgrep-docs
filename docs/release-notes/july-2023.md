# July 2023 release notes

## Semgrep OSS Engine

This section of release notes includes upgrades of Semgrep OSS Engine for versions between **1.31.0** and **1.34.1**.

### Added

* Added rule option `interfile: true`, which is set under the `options` key. This is now the preferred method of setting `interfile` to `true`. While `interfile` can still be set under the `metadata` key, this should be avoided because metadata is not meant to have any effect on how a rule is run.
* Added new `--legacy` flag to force the use of the Python implementation of Semgrep (also known as 'pysemgrep'). Note that by default most `semgrep` commands are still using the Python implementation (except `semgrep interactive`), so in practice you don't need to add this flag, but as Semgrep Inc. ports more commands to OCaml, the new `--legacy` flag might be useful if you find some regressions.
* Julia: Added support for metavariable type.
* PromQL (Prometheus Query Language): Initial language support. Thank you to [Michael Hoffman](https://github.com/MichaHoffmann) for his contribution! ([#8281](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/pull/8281))

* PromQL: Added `parse_promql_duration` function to convert a PromQL duration into milliseconds([#8381](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/pull/8381)). This makes it possible to write comparisons such as:
    ```yaml
    - metavariable-comparison:
        metavariable: $RANGE
            comparison: parse_promql_duration(str($RANGE)) > parse_promql_duration("1d")
    ``` 
* `.h` files now run when C or C++ are selected as the language.
* `.cjs` and `.mjs` files now run when JavaScript is selected as the language. 
* Rule syntax: Added metavariable type extension for Semgrep Rule Syntax 2.0 (also known as Experimental Semgrep Syntax). This addition introduces recent changes in Semgrep rule syntax 1.0 to the experimental syntax as well. ([#8183](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/issues/8183))
    ```yaml
    # previous rule syntax 2.0
    rules:
      - id: no-string-eqeq
        message: find errors
        severity: WARNING
        languages:
          - java
        match:
          all:
            - not: null == (String $Y)
            - $X == (String $Y)
    ```
    ```yaml
   # new additions to rule syntax 2.0 (experimental syntax)
    rules:
      - id: no-string-eqeq
        message: find errors
        severity: WARNING
        languages:
          - java
        match:
          all:
            - not: null == $Y
            - $X == $Y
          where:
            - metavariable: $Y
              type: String 
    ```
* Taint analysis: Parameters to functions in languages with pattern matching in function arguments, such as Rust and OCaml, now transmit taint when they are sources. This works with nested patterns too. For example, in Rust:
    ```rust
    fn f ((x, (y, z)): t) {
      let x = 2;
    }
    ```
    Tainting the sole argument to this function results in all of the identifiers `x`, `y`, and `z` now being tainted. ([#8216](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/pull/8216))
* Rust: Added support for ellipsis patterns in attribute argument positions. For example, `#[get(...)]`. ([#8148](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/pull/8234))
* Rust: Added typed metavariable support for Rust. Users can create `TypedMetavar` using Rust's type annotation syntax `:`. For example, the following rule works for matching `HttpResponseBuilder` type of variables:
    ```yaml
    rules:
    - id: no-direct-response-write
      patterns:
      - pattern: '($BUILDER : HttpResponseBuilder).body(...)'
      - pattern-not: '($BUILDER : HttpResponseBuilder).body("...".to_string())'
      message: find dangerous codes
      severity: WARNING
      languages: [rust]
    ```
* Rust: Added the ability to taint macro calls through its arguments, in macro calls with multiple arguments. (#[8209](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/pull/8209))
* Matching: Added the ability to use metavariables in parameters to match more sophisticated kinds of parameters. In particular, metavariables should now be able to match `self` parameters, such as in Rust. For example: 
    ```rust
    fn $F($X, ...) { ... }
    ```
    should match:
    ```rust
    fn $F(self) { }
    ```
* Added support for naming propagation when the left-hand side (LHS) of a variable definition is an **identifier pattern**. In certain languages such as Rust, the variable definition is parsed as a pattern assignment, for example:
    ```rust
    let x: SomeType = SomeFunction();
    ```
   This commit ensures that the annotated type is propagated to the identifier pattern on the left-hand side (LHS) of the assignment, thus ensuring proper naming behavior. 
* **Taint-mode:** Added experimental `control: true` option to `pattern-sources`. For example:
    ```yaml
    pattern-sources:
      - control: true
          pattern: source(...)
    ```
    * Such sources taint the "control flow" (or the program counter) so that it is possible to implement reachability queries that do not require the flow of any data. Thus, Semgrep reports a finding in the code below, because after source() the flow of control will reach sink(), even if no data is flowing between both:
    ```yaml
    def test():
      source()
      foo()
      bar()
      #ruleid: test
      sink()
    ``` (pa-2958)
* Taint mode: Taint sanitizers will be included in matching explanations. ([#8383](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/issues/8383))

### Fixed

- Dockerfile language support: String matching is now done by contents, treating the strings `foo`, `'foo'`, or `"foo"` as equal. ([#8229](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/pull/8229))
- Dockerfile: Single-quoted strings are now parsed without an error. ([#7780](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/pull/7780))
- Julia: Fixed a bug where try-catch patterns would not match properly. Now, you can use an empty try-catch pattern, such as:
    ```julia
    try
      ...
    catch
      ...
    end
    ```
    to catch only Julia code which does not specify an identifier for the catch.
    - Otherwise, if you want to match any kind of try-catch, you can specify an ellipsis for the catch identifier instead:
    ```julia
    try
      ...
    catch ...
      ...
    end
    ```
    and this matches any try-catch, including those that do not specify an identifier for the catch. It is strictly more general than the previous.
- TypeScript and JavaScript: Fixed an issue leading to incorrect autofix results involving JS/TS async arrow functions, for example, `async () => {}` ([#7353](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/pull/7353))
- Go: Fixed issue with patterns such as:
    - `make(...);` 
    - `make(...,$X);` 
    - `make($A,$B)` ([#8171](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/pull/8171))
- Rust: Fixed an issue where implicit returns did not allow taint to flow, and various other small translation issues that would affect taint. ([#8325](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/pull/8325))
- Rust: Fixed attribute patterns to allow matching on simple attribute syntax. ([#8234](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/pull/8234))
- Rust: Fixed a bug where standalone metavariable patterns were not matching as expected. ([#8206](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/pull/8206)) 
- Rust: Macro calls which involve dereferencing and reference operators (such as `foo!(&x)` and `foo!(*x)`) now properly transmit taint.
- Fixed Python Semgrep pattern parsing to also parse match statements, by chaining in the Python tree-sitter parser, and adding metavariable support to the Python tree-sitter parser.
- Aliengrep mode: Fix whitespace bug preventing correct matching of parentheses. ([#7990](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/pull/7990))
- Fixed stack overflow caused by symbolic propagation.


### Removed

- **Dart** has been removed from experimental support.

## Semgrep Cloud Platform

### Added

- Jira integration is now in **private beta** for existing customers.
    - You can **create Jira tickets** from Semgrep Cloud Platform by following steps in the [Jira integration documentation](/semgrep-cloud-platform/jira/).
    - To enable this feature:
         1. Fill out the following form: [Request access to the Semgrep Jira integration private beta](https://get.semgrep.dev/Jira-private-beta.html).
        2. Contact your Technical Account Manager or your Account Executive and let them know you'd like to try out the Jira integration.
- Usage limits are now in effect as of July 31, 2023. See the [Usage](/usage-and-billing) document to learn more.
- Various bugfixes and improvements.

## Semgrep Code

### Added

- Added **open findings** column to the **Policies** page. This column displays the count of open findings for each rule in your Policies. With this column, you can quickly see which rules are producing the most or least amount of findings.
- Added **fix rate** column to the **Policies** page. This column displays a percentage of resolved fixes associated with the rule, or  "-" if there are no findings for that rule.
- Added **Label** as its own column in the **Policies** page.
- Added icons for **Severity** and **Source** columns in the **Policies** page. The following icons can be seen in the **Source** columns:
    - <i class="fa-solid fa-pen-nib"></i> Custom rules
    - <i class="fa-solid fa-diagram-project"></i> Community rules
    - <i class="fa-solid fa-crown"></i> Semgrep Pro rules

![Icons for Sources and Severities](/img/july2023-newicons.png)

### Changed

- **Policies** page: Rules are now sorted by mode, then by custom rules, then by Semgrep Pro rules, then by Community rules.
- Targets in a `.yarn/` folder or directory are now ignored by the default `.semgrepignore` patterns.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with the **Findings** page > **Triage** button in which the **Ignore** button was previously disabled when the **Note** or **Comment** textbox was empty. It has been fixed to let users **Ignore** the finding without filling the text box.

### Removed

- The **Rule board** has been deprecated and removed. The [Policies page](/semgrep-code/policies) is now the default and sole page for rule management in Semgrep Cloud Platform.

## Semgrep Supply Chain

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in `gradle.lockfile` parser where Semgrep Supply Chain previously threw errors on `empty=` with nothing after it.
- `poetry.lock` parsing: Semgrep Supply Chain now correctly handles empty `toml` tables, quoted table keys, and arbitrarily placed comments.
- Exceptions raised during parsing of manifest files no longer interrupt general parser execution, which previously prevented lockfile parsing if a manifest failed to parse. 

## Semgrep Assistant

### Added

- Semgrep Assistant is now in public beta. Semgrep Assistant is available to any user of Semgrep Cloud Platform. To try it out, see [Enabling Semgrep Assistant](/semgrep-code/semgrep-assistant-code/#enabling-semgrep-assistant).
- Semgrep Assistant now suggests **rule categories** for your rules through the **Assistant recommendations** in the **Dashboard page**. Click the **Accept** button for Semgrep Assistant to automatically update the rule with its suggested category.
