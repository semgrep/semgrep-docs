# Semgrep release notes for February 2025

## üåê Semgrep AppSec Platform

### Added

- Semgrep Managed Scans for repositories hosted by **Bitbucket Cloud** is now in public beta.
- You can now manage enrollment in Semgrep Managed Scans through the Semgrep API's `/project` and `/project/managed-scan` endpoints.

### Changed

- The Semgrep AppSec Platform-specific metadata fields `semgrep.dev:` and `semgrep.policy:` are now filtered from the JSON output if you aren't signed into your Semgrep account. See [Semgrep JSON and SARIF fields](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-appsec-platform/json-and-sarif#json) for more information.
- The Semgrep Docker image has been updated to use Python 3.12 and OCaml 5.2.1.
- **CLI**: The output generated from running `semgrep ci --help` no longer includes information about experimental features and flags.
- **Jira**: Jira tickets for Supply Chain findings now display recommended versions of packages in the description.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue in Semgrep Editor's Structure Mode where some of the larger language icons overlapped due to limited space.
- Fixed an issue where the instruction links for adding a CI job all lead to GitHub-specific instructions.
- Fixed an issue where the Median Open Age chart didn't display all relevant findings.
- Fixed an issue where Semgrep scans did not complete if there were failures involving `git worktree remove`; instead of erring out, Semgrep completes the scan, but logs the error.

## üíª Semgrep Code

### Added

- Added support for **Critical** severity level to denote the highest level of severity for a Code finding. You can now filter by Critical severity level in Semgrep AppSec Platform, and you can identify rules that generate critical severity findings by the red circle <i class="fa-solid fa-circle"></i> badge.
