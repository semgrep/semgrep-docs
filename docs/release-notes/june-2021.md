# June 2021

## Version 0.57.0

### Additions

- New options: field in a YAML rule to enable/disable certain features (for example constant propagation) (For the list of available features you can enable/disable see [https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/blob/develop/interfaces/Rule_options.atd](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/blob/develop/interfaces/Rule_options.atd)).
- Capture groups in pattern-regex: in $1, $2, etc. ([#3356](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3356))
- Support metavariables inside atoms (e.g., foo(:$ATOM))
- Support metavariables and ellipsis inside regexp literals (for example `foo(/.../)`)
- Associative-commutative matching for bitwise OR, AND, and XOR operations
- Add support for $...MVAR in generic patterns
- Add support for $...MVAR in generic patterns
- metavariable-pattern: Add support for nested Spacegrep/regex/Comby patterns
- C#: support ellipsis in method parameters ([#3289](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3289))

### Fixes

- C#: parse __makeref, __reftype, __refvalue ([#3364](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3364))
- Java: parsing of dots inside function annotations with brackets ([#3389](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3389))
- Do not pretend that short-circuit Boolean AND and OR operators are commutative ([#3399](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3399))
- metavariable-pattern: Fix crash when nesting a non-generic pattern within a generic rule
- metavariable-pattern: Fix parse info when matching content of a metavariable under a different language
- generic mode on Markdown files with very long lines will now work ([#2987](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/2987))

### Changes

- generic mode: files that don't look like nicely-indented programs are no longer ignored, which may cause accidental slowdowns in setups where excessively large files are not excluded explicitly ([#3418](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3418))
- metavariable-comparison: Fix crash when comparing integers and floats
- Do not filter findings with the same range but different metavariable bindings ([#3310](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3310))
- Set parsing_state.have_timeout when a timeout occurs ([#3438](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3438))
- Set a timeout of 10s per file ([#3434](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3434))
- Improvements to contributing documentation ([#3353](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3353))
- Memoize getting ranges to speed up rules with large ranges
- When and-ed with other patterns, pattern: $X will not be evaluated on its own, but will look at the context and find $X within the metavariables bound, which should be significantly faster

## Version 0.56.0

### Additions

- Associative-commutative matching for Boolean AND and OR operations ([#3198](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3198))
- Support metavariables inside strings (e.g., foo("$VAR"))
- Support metavariables inside atoms (e.g., foo(:$ATOM))
- metavariable-pattern: allow matching the content of a metavariable under a different language

### Fixes

- C#: Parse attributes for local functions ([#3348](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3348))
- Go: Recognize other common package naming conventions ([#2424](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/2424))

### Changes

- Upgraded TypeScript parser ([#3102](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3102))

## Version 0.55.1

### Additions

- Added new metavariable-pattern operator (available only via --optimizations), thanks to Kai Zhong for the feature request ([#3257](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3257))
- Add helpUri to SARIF output if rule source metadata is defined

### Fixes

- C#: Support unsafe block syntax ([#3283](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3283))
- Generic mode: fixed wrong line numbers for multi-lines match ([#3315](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3315))
- JavaScript: support partial field definitions pattern, like in JSON
- JSON: handle correctly metavariables as field ([#3279](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3279))
- PHP: Support ellipsis in include/require and echo ([#3191](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3191),[#3245](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3245))
- PHP: Prefer expression patterns over statement patterns ([#3191](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3191))
- Python: support ellipsis in try-except ([#3233](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3233))
- Scala: correctly parse symbol literals and interpolated strings containing double dollars ([#3271](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3271))
- Taint mode: Allow statement-patterns when these are represented as statement-expressions in the Generic AST ([#3191](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3191))
- Dataflow: Analyze foreach body even if we do not handle the pattern yet (#3155)
- Correctly handle ellipsis inside function types ([#3119](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3119))
- Fall back to no optimizations when using unsupported features: pattern-where-python, taint rules, and --debugging-json ([#3265](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3265))
- Handle regexp parse errors gracefully when using optimizations ([#3266](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3266))
- Support equivalences when using optimizations ([#3259](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3259))

### Changes

- Run rules in semgrep-core (rather than patterns) by default (these are the optimizations described above)

## Version 0.54.0

This version includes release notes for Semgrep version 0.53.0 as well.

### Additions

- Alpha support for Scala
- Metrics collection of project_hash in cases where git is not available
- Taint mode now also analyzes top-level statements
- Per rule parse times and per rule-file parse and match times added to opt-in metrics
- $...MVAR can now match a list of statements (not just a list of arguments) ([#3170](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3170))

### Fixes

- JavaScript parsing: Support decorators on properties
- JavaScript parsing: Allow default export for any declaration
- Metavariables in messages are filled in when using --optimizations all
- Respect --timeout-threshold option in --optimizations all mode
- Python: class variables are matched in any order ([#3212](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3212))
- Running with --strict will now return results if there are nosem mismatches. Semgrep will report a nonzero exit code if --strict is set and there are nosem mismatches ([#3099](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3099))
- PHP: parsing correctly ... and metavariables in parameters
- PHP: parsing correctly functions with a single statement in their body
- Evaluate interpolated strings during constant propagation ([#3127](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3127))
- Semgrep will report an InvalidRuleSchemaError for dictionaries with duplicate key names ([#3084](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3084))
- Basic type inference also for implicit variable declarations (Python, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript)
- JavaScript/TypeScript: differentiating tagged template literals in the AST ([#3187](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3187))
- Ruby: storing parenthesis in function calls in the AST ([#3178](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3178))

### Changes

- Moved some debug logging to verbose logging
- $...ARGS can now match an empty list of arguments, just like ... ([#3177](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3177))
- JSON and SARIF outputs sort keys for predictable results
