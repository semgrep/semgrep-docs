- **Semgrep Managed Scans**: scans now follow fail open behavior, consistent with how Semgrep in CI behaves. 
- The **Projects** page's **See findings** button is now a drop-down box, enabling you to select which product you want to view findings for.

## üíª Semgrep Code

### Added

- Developers can now triage findings by replying to a GitHub PR comment from Semgrep, without the need to log in to Semgrep Cloud Platform. See [Triage findings through comments](/semgrep-code/triage-remediation#triage-findings-through-pr-and-mr-comments) for more information.
- Bulk triage findings API endpoint tk
- Taint analysis now has support for tracking sinks through callbacks.

### Changed

### Fixed

## ‚õìÔ∏è Semgrep Supply Chain

### Added

- Supply Chain now provides reachability analysis for Kotlin, including support for Gradle and Maven.
- Improved support and flexibility to Python dependency parsing (public beta):
  - Semgrep now finds non-standard `requirements.txt` names and parses them for dependencies. 
  - Semgrep parses lockfiles in a `requirements` folder.

### Changed

- Improvements to the **Advisories** page UI. <!-- 16657 -->
- **Dependency search**: The **Ecosystem** filter has been replaced by a **Language** filter. Several languages can share the same ecosystem, such as Java and Kotlin both using Maven. For accurate filtering, the Dependencies page now uses a Language filter so that you can view that language's packages from any ecosystem supported by Semgrep for that language.

### Fixed

- Improved speed when fetching advisories.

## ü§ñ Semgrep Assistant

### Added

- Users can now use Semgrep Assistant with their own OpenAI API key.
  - Enterprise users can also use the following API providers:
    - Azure OpenAI
    - AWS Bedrock
    - Google Gemini
 - See the [AI provider documentation](/semgrep-assistant/getting-started#use-your-ai-provider) for more details.
- PR comments made by Semgrep Assistant now reference the Git commits that it used to generate the fix. <!-- 17152 -->
