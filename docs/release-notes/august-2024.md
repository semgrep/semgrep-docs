# Semgrep release notes for August 2024

## üåê Semgrep AppSec Platform

### Added

- A new **primary branch** feature is now generally available (GA)! This feature enables you to set your repository's default branch. Previously, Semgrep automatically detected primary branches through a list of common names, such as `main` or `master`, but now you can set it to any unique name your organization may use, such as `prod-1`. [Read the documentation](/deployment/primary-branch).
- **Semgrep Managed Scans**: You can now view logs of all scans by going to the project's **Details** page.
- **Projects > Details page**: For projects using Semgrep in CI, you are now able to view the job log for a particular scan <!-- 15974 -->
- **Jira**: Added multi-label support when creating Jira tickets. Use a comma to delineate labels.
- Added initial page state for **Project > Details > Scans** tab. <!-- 15805 -->

### Changed

- Various improvements and updates to the Semgrep pricing page. <!-- 16210 -->
- Improvements to tooltips, help text, and icons in the **Projects** and **Findings** pages. <!-- 16246, 16186, 16058 -->
- **Semgrep Managed Scans**: Improved error messages to users when clicking **Run a new scan** from the **Projects > Details** page. Now users are better equipped to troubleshoot issues with managed scans. <!-- 16025 -->
- Updated the Buildkite CI configuration template. <!-- 15932 -->
- **Code search**: YAML is now validated in the search step and invalid YAML is caught when viewing results. <!-- 15886 -->

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug which prevented error messages from appearing in tooltips when Jira tickets failed to be created. Now, users can see detailed error messages letting them know what went wrong when a Jira ticket is not successfully created through Semgrep. <!-- 16259 -->
- Fixed a regression in which clicking outside of the **Findings** page filter component did not clear all filters.
- Various copy edits to the Dashboard (beta) page. <!-- 16176 -->
- Fixed an issue in which untriaged findings could be marked as reopened when creating Jira tickets from the **Finding details** page. <!-- 15969 -->
- Fixed a bug in which the **Dashboard** did not display the correct number of findings. <!-- 15935-->
