# Semgrep release notes for August 2024

## 🌐 Semgrep AppSec Platform

### Added

- A new **primary branch** feature is now in private beta. This feature enables you to set your repository's default branch. Previously, Semgrep automatically detected primary branches through a list of common names, such as `main` or `master`, but now you can set it to any unique name your organization may use, such as `prod-1`.
