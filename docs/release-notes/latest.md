## üåê Semgrep Cloud Platform

### Added

- UX: Added a new **onboarding** flow. This onboarding flow streamlines the following steps to ensure that users are able to quickly add repositories for scanning with Semgrep: <!-- #10473 -->
	- **Deployment creation**. The Semgrep team has made improvements to Semgrep account creation and connecting your source code manager, such as GitHub or GitLab. 
	- **Onboarding checklist.** This helps you troubleshoot and resolve any issues early on in your journey.
	- **Tour of features**. Make the most of your Semgrep experience by learning what features are available to you.
- Logging into Semgrep Cloud Platform through the CLI associates your CLI user ID to your Semgrep Cloud Platform account. See the [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Anonymous User ID](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/blob/develop/PRIVACY.md#anonymous-user-id) section for more details.

### Changed

- **SCM configuration:** Improved the **Delete message** when deleting SCMs, so that you are aware of the implications of removing an SCM. Many major Semgrep features rely on a connection with your source code manager, so take care when deleting SCMs.

### Fixed

- **GitLab:** Fixed the GitLab CI sample configuration file to help users onboard GitLab repositories more clearly. In particular, the configuration file now includes the `GITLAB_TOKEN` environment variable, which was previously only in the docs.
- Fixed a timeout issue when syncing large numbers (15,000+) of GitHub repositories in Semgrep Cloud Platform.
- Fixed performance issues when synchronizing Semgrep Cloud Platform Projects with their corresponding GitHub repositories <!-- 10156 -->

## üíª Semgrep Code

### Changed

- **Findings page:** By default, the findings page now displays findings from **default (trunk or main) branches**. You can customize this filter by selecting a value from the **Branch** drop-down menu.

### Fixed

- Various UX/UI bugfixes in the Findings page. 

## ‚õìÔ∏è Semgrep Supply Chain

### Added

- **Filtering:** Allow users to select more than one branch at a time.

## ü§ñ Semgrep Assistant (beta)

### Added

- **GitLab:** Semgrep Assistant now supports GitLab cloud hosted and self-managed repositories.
- **Findings page**: Semgrep Assistant verdicts now appear in the Findings page if Assistant recommends that the finding should be **Ignored**. <!-- #10438 -->
![Sample finding entry with Semgrep Assistant verdict](/img/sept-2023-assistant-findings.png)
- **Finding Details page:** For findings with autofixes, the finding's detail page includes a link to the PR comment with the autofix since the PR comment allows for directly committing the autofix. <!-- #10516 -->

### Fixed

- **GitLab:** Fixed a bug in which comments were not appearing on GitLab.com cloud-hosted repositories.

## üìù Documentation and knowledge base

### Added

* New knowledge base articles:
    * [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Failed to run a git command during pull or merge request scans](/kb/semgrep-ci/git-command-errors/)
    * [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> How to exclude certain file types for a particular rule](kb/rules/exclude_rule_for_certain_filetypes/)

* [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Semgrep Assistant](/semgrep-code/semgrep-assistant-code/#enabling-semgrep-assistant): Added a guide to setting up Assistant on GitLab MRs.
* [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Supported languages](/supported-languages/#language-maturity-factors-pro-engine): Added a section on Semgrep Pro Engine language maturity factors. These are the criteria that determine if a language is generally available (GA) or beta.

* Clarifications on various Semgrep Supply Chain behaviors.
* [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Sample CI configurations](semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/):  Updated various CI configurations for standalone SAST scans.
