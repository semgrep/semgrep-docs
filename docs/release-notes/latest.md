## üåê Semgrep Cloud Platform

### Added
- Added a button to **Remove** source code manager (SCM) apps. This is helpful when you have a misconfigured SCM app, such as GitHub's `semgrep-app`, and want to reinstall it. <!--(10688)--> To remove an SCM, click **<i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> Settings > Source code managers**.

- Added Semgrep Assistant to the new onboarding flow. <!--(10716) -->
- **OpenAPI:** Renamed instances of r2c to Semgrep. <!--(10685) -->
- **CLI login:** New users are now directed to create a Semgrep org when they are logging in for the first time to Semgrep Cloud Platform from the CLI. <!-- (10596) -->

### Fixed

- Fixed UI issues in the new onboarding flow.
- Fixed an issue where Semgrep Cloud Platform could crash during the onboarding flow. <!--(#10940) -->
- Various frontend fixes and improvements to the following:
	- Finding detail page
	- Projects page
- Fixed an issue where the **Delete user** functionality did not work for some Semgrep orgs. <!-- (#10756) -->

### Changed

- Updated the default CircleCI YAML snippet to include full and diff scans. <!-- (#10678) -->

## üíª Semgrep Code

### Fixed

- Speed and stability improvements across the product. Semgrep Code pages, such as Findings and Policies, now load faster.
- **Semgrep Assistant:** Component tags are now visible for all Assistant users.
    - **Component tags** use GPT-4 to categorize your code based on its function, such as:
        - Payments
        - User authentication
        - Infrastructure
    - By categorizing your code through component tags, Semgrep Assistant is able to help you prioritize **high-risk issues**, for example if Semgrep has detected a code finding related to payments or user authentication.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Semgrep Supply Chain

### Added

- Added a new, public [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Semgrep Supply Chain API](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/#tag/SupplyChainService) where you can filter and query third-party vulnerability findings by a variety of parameters, such as:
    - Severity
    - Repository
    - Exposure
- **C# reachability** is now **GA (generally available)**. Semgrep Supply Chain has added reachability rule support for all C# CVEs from May 2022 onward.
- **SBOM export:** Add vulnerabilities enriched with reachability analysis to export SBOMs. <!-- (#10879 ) -->
- Dependency license scanning:
    - Added support for NuGet (C#) license detection. <!-- (10777) -->
    - Added support for RubyGems (Ruby) license detection.
- **Advisories:** Added a tooltip displaying the date when a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) created the security advisory. [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> CVE Numbering Authorities](https://nvd.nist.gov/general/cve-process) include the MITRE Corporation. These dates are not assigned by Semgrep, Inc. <!-- (10743) -->

### Fixed

* **SBOM (software bill of materials) export:** Fixed an issue where SBOM export failed when encountering dependencies with empty names.

### Changed

- **SBOM export:** The name of the exported SBOM file now follows the following format: `sbom-<org_name>-<repo_name>-<MM-DD-YY_H-m-s>--<serial_number>.<xml|json>` <!-- (10850) -->

## üîê Semgrep Secrets (beta)

### Added

- Semgrep Secrets is now in **public beta**.
- **Projects page:** Added a new column to display a Semgrep Secrets counter. This counter counts all secrets regardless of validation state. <!--(10588)-->

### Fixed

- Fixed links to branches in GitLab self-hosted repositories. <!-- (#10897) -->
