# September 2022

## Semgrep App

### Changes

- The Findings page has been updated with UX/UI improvements to its filtering and triage functions.
- The Dashboard page has been updated with UI improvements.

### Bug fixes

- Previously, users could not receive merge request (MR) comments within GitLab repositories. This issue has been fixed. Users can now receive MR comments in GitLab from Semgrep App.
- Update git URL parser to support optional organization after the hostname. For example `https://some.enterprise.scm/myorg/owner/repo`.
- Various fixes and improvements to speed.

## Semgrep CLI

These release notes include upgrades for versions ranging between 0.112.0 and 0.115.0.

### Additions

- Exclude rules by ID using CLI flag `--exclude-rule`. To exclude a specific rule, use for example <code>semgrep --config=auto --exclude <span className="placeholder">RULE_ID</span></code>. (Issue [2530](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/2530), PR [5974](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/5974))

- You can now have multiple metavariables under `focus-metavariable`, which allows. Semgrep to highlight the values matched by multiple metavariables more easily in certain circumstances. For more information, see [Using multiple focus metavariables](/writing-rules/experiments/multiple-focus-metavariables/) documentation. (Issue [5686](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/5686))

- You can add tags for specific projects in the Semgrep App on the configuration page of a project. With this update, you can create `.semgrepconfig.yml` file in the root directory of your repository and add tags in this file also. See [Managing projects through tags](/semgrep-cloud-platform/tags/).

- The Semgrep CLI output now displays non-blocking and blocking findings separately. CLI output also provides a list of the blocking rules that matched the code.

- taint-mode: Experimental support for basic field-sensitive taint tracking. Semgrep can now track `x.a` and `x.b` separately, so that for example: `x.a` can be tainted at the same time as `x.b` is clean, hence `sink(x.a)` can produce a finding but `sink(x.b)` does not. It is also possible for `x` to be tainted while `x.a` is clean. As a result, the number of false positives that Semgrep reports is reduced.

### Changes

- generic mode: Allow text input up to 500 bytes without human-readable indentation. This value is subject to change. This relaxation is intended to facilitate testing a long line without a trailing newline. Semgrep users should not expect files that are not human-readable to be processed by Semgrep's generic mode, or in any mode. (Issues [6071](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/6071), [6162](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/6162))

- Changed behavior for renamed files in diff-aware scans. Semgrep no longer displays old issues to developers when they rename a file. As a result, findings in renamed files are displayed for security engineers but do not block or spam developers. (Issue [6157](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/6157))
