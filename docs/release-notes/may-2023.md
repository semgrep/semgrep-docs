# May 2023

:::info Release notes from May until June 9th
These release notes include updates made by Semgrep, Inc during May 2023 until the June 9th. Due to the importance of the launch week at the beginning of June 2023, we decided to include the most important updates from the launch also on the release notes page that you are now reading.
:::

# Semgrep tiers

- Semgrep’s Community Tier has been sunsetted. Existing and new users now have access to all Semgrep Team tier features for free, subject to [usage limits](/usage-limits/).

# Semgrep Cloud Platform

- Semgrep Playground **Turbo mode** is now in beta. This new mode enables users to create rules using the Semgrep OSS engine which will automatically run upon detecting any change in the rule or sample code. There is **no need to click a Run button** in Turbo mode.
- Semgrep Zero-config Scanning for GitHub.com is now in beta. Onboard or add many repositories to the Semgrep Cloud Platform without having to commit a CI file for every repository! Reach out to [sales@semgrep.com](mailto:sales@semgrep.com) to try it out.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is now available to all Team tier users, subject to usage limits.
- Single Sign-On (SSO) is now available to all Team tier users, subject to usage limits.
- Improved the UI in the **Settings** page.

# Semgrep OSS Engine

This section of release notes includes upgrades of Semgrep OSS Engine for versions ranging between 1.21.0 and 1.25.0.

- Kotlin language support update: Kotlin now upgraded from beta support to full GA support! Additionally, as a part of this update for Kotlin:
    - Added named ellipses, as `$...X`.
    - Added literal metavariables, from patterns like `"$FOO"`. You can still match strings that only contain a single interpolated ident by using the brace notation, e.g. `"${FOO}"`.
    - Interpolated identifiers in strings, such as `$foo`, are now properly able to match explicitly interpolated expressions, such as `${...}`.
- Added experimental support for programming language Cairo 1.0. Thanks to [Frostweeds](https://github.com/Frostweeds) (Romain Jufer) for his contribution!
- Added experimental support for programming language Julia.
- Java support improvement: Semgrep OSS Engine now includes heuristics based on the Java standard library and common naming patterns. As a result, Semgrep OSS Engine can now determine the types of more Java expressions, for use with typed metavariables (https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/pattern-syntax/#typed-metavariables).
- We are introducing a new experimental generic matching engine [Aliengrep](/writing-rules/experiments/aliengrep/) an alternative to the default generic mode engine (Spacegrep). Generic mode is used for programming languages that are not supported by Semgrep OSS Engine. Try out [Aliengrep](/writing-rules/experiments/aliengrep/) and let us know what you think about so we can improve it!
- Taint analysis: Semgrep knows that an object constructed by `new Obj("tainted", "safe")` has its `x` attribute tainted, whereas its `y` attribute is safe.
- Extract mode: users can now choose to include or exclude rules to run on, similar to `paths:`.
    
    For example, to only run the rules on `example-1` and `example-2`:
    
    ```yaml
    rules:
       - id: test-rule
         mode: extract
         rules:
            include:
            - example-1
            - example-2
    
    ```
    
    To run the rule on everything except `example-1` and `example-2`:
    
    ```yaml
    rules:
       - id: test-rule
         mode: extract
         rules:
            exclude:
            - example-1
            - example-2
    
    ```
    
    (GitHub issue [#7858](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/7858))
    
- Semgrep OSS Engine Language Server updates (also related to [Semgrep Visual Studio Code extension](#semgrep-visual-studio-code-extension):
    - Support for search and replace with rule patterns through semgrep/search.
    - Language Server now notifies users of errors, and reason for crash.
- Relaxed restrictions on symbolic propagation so that symbolic values survive
branching statements. Now (with symbolic-propagation enabled) `foo(bar())` 
matches the following code:
    
    ```
    def test():
      x = bar()
      if cond:
        exit()
      foo(x)
    ```
    

Semgrep OSS Engine section of release notes mentions only selected additions and changes, for specific bug fixes, see [Semgrep OSS Engine GitHub](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md) changelog and look for Fixed sections under each version.

# Semgrep Supply Chain

- Semgrep Supply Chain’s **License compliance** feature is now in beta. This feature enables developers to view the licenses of dependencies in all repositories that are scanned by Semgrep Supply Chain. Read the documentation: [License compliance](/semgrep-supply-chain/license-compliance).
    - This feature also enables security engineers to **Block,** leave a **Comment,** or **Allow** dependencies when a PR introducing the dependency is first opened, based on the license of the dependency.
    - License compliance supports many popular Copyleft, Weak-copyleft, and Permissive licenses. Other licenses can also be detected.
- Semgrep Supply Chain is now available for free to Team tier users, subject to usage limits.
- Improvements to Semgrep Supply Chain **Dependencies** page.

# Semgrep Visual Studio Code

Semgrep Visual Studio Code extension received new updates! Try to scan your code using the extension and let us now what we can improve. See more in [Semgrep Visual Studio Code extension](/extensions/semgrep-vs-code/) documentation. This extension allows you to check your code for vulnerabilities within seconds, with every line of code changed in the editor. The extension is built on Language Server Protocol, so you can hack it for other editors of your choice. The extension also has a dedicated [changelog on GitHub](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-vscode/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) so you can always see the latest updates.

# Semgrep Code

- A new Rule board version is available in Semgrep Code! The new Rule board page is called Policies. Switch to the new version by clicking **Try new version** in the Rule board header. Beside a facelift and many optimizations, you can now easily filter for various types of rule metadata, specific types of rules and make bulk edits which would have been hardly achievable with the old Rule board. Read more in [Policies](/semgrep-code/policies/) documentation.

    ![Screenshot of the default state of the Policies page](/img/policies.png)
    
- You can now rename Projects in Semgrep Cloud Platform. Before this update, when you renamed a repository in your Source Code Manager (SCM), for example in GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, all of your previous Semgrep findings and triage data were lost as Semgrep recognized the renamed repository only as a new repository. With this update, you can now manually rename the project in Semgrep Code. This is a first step before we will bring you an automated solution (as this update still requires a manual action). But now you can rename a project in Semgrep Code to match the new repository name without loosing your findings data!

    To rename a repository:
    
    1. On the [Projects](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/projects) page of Semgrep Cloud Platform, click the cog icon **Settings**. of the repository where you want to change the repository name.
    2. Click the three dots …, and then click Rename project.
    3. Create a name that matches the name in your SCM, and then click **Rename**.

## Pro rules

Recently released rules bring a total of:

- 61 Pro rules for **Kotlin** (with support frameworks like Spring and Ktor)
- 69 Pro rules for **Go** (with support frameworks like Gin, Gorilla, Grpc, net/http and more)

These rules are available through the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore), in rulesets such as `p/default` and `p/comment`, as well as language-specific rulesets such as `p/kotlin` and `p/golang`. In total, there are now more than 500 ****Pro rules.

 

# Semgrep Pro Engine

- Semgrep Pro Engine now provides cross-function support for Go and Kotlin!
- Semgrep Pro Engine allows you to visualize flow of tainted data (dataflow traces) in Semgrep Code. With this update, you can also receive findings with visualized flow of tainted data in pull request (PR) or merge request (MR) Semgrep comments. For more information, see the following documentation:
    - [Dataflow traces in PR comments](/semgrep-cloud-platform/github-pr-comments/#dataflow-traces-in-pr-comments)
    - [Dataflow traces in MR comments](/semgrep-cloud-platform/gitlab-mr-comments/#dataflow-traces-in-mr-comments)
- Taint analysis:
    - Taint labels now mostly work interprocedurally, except for labeled propagators.
    Note that taint labels are experimental!
    - Taint analysis now supports interprocedural field-sensitivity for JavaScript and TypeScript.
        
        For example:
        
        ```javascript
        class Obj {
          constructor(x, y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
          }
        }
        ```
        
    - Semgrep Pro Engine taint analysis can now perform field-sensitive analysis of class constructors in Java. For example, if the default constructor of a class `C` sets its field `x` to a tainted value, given `o = new C()`, Semgrep knows that `o.getX()` is tainted.
