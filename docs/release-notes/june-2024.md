# Semgrep release notes for June 2024

## 🌐 Semgrep AppSec Platform

### Added

- <!-- Per-product ignores -->
- <!-- Managed scans SCM -->
- <!-- Jira v3 + added features -->

### Changed

- <!-- Project page sorting: sort projects by name and last scan time -->

### Fixed

## 💻 Semgrep Code

### Added

- Added support for the `--subdir` command, which enables scanning monorepos in parts. `--subdir` accepts the path to a subdirectory, then runs Semgrep on the specified subdirectory and ensures that the file links displayed in Semgrep AppSec Platform are correct.
- Added traces to help debug the performance of tainting. To send traces added in the PR, pass `--trace` and set the environment variable `SEMGREP_TRACE_LEVEL=trace`. To send traces to a local endpoint instead of Semgrep's default endpoint, use `--trace-endpoint`.

### Changed

- Removed URLs at the end of logs generated whenever `semgrep ci --dryrun` is run. Dry runs run locally without results uploaded to Semgrep AppSec Platform, so the URL is unnecessary.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue that caused findings to display the message, "Untriaged by Semgrep because a related issue was untriaged."

## ⛓️  Semgrep Supply Chain

### Added

- <!-- Disable PR/MR comments -->

### Changed

### Fixed

## 🤖 Semgrep Assistant

### Added

- Added the Assistant **Analyze** button to Semgrep Code's findings details page.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with Assistant causing long wait times for analysis results.

## 🔐 Semgrep Secrets

### Added

- Added a pop-up confirmation in Semgrep AppSec Platform that enabling historical secrets results in longer scan times.

### Changed

- Changed the details page for Secrets findings to match findings identified by Semgrep Code and Semgrep Supply Chain.
- Changed Secrets findings to rely on the findings severity instead of rule severity, since a validator can override the latter value.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where Semgrep Code incorrectly ran alongside Semgrep Secrets. This occurred when there were files that:
  - Should be scanned by Semgrep Secrets but ignored by Semgrep Code
  - Contained Python functions with annotations ending in `endpoint`, `route`, `get`, `patch`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, `before_request`, or `after_request`
