# Semgrep release notes for July 2024

## üåê Semgrep AppSec Platform

### Added

<!-- Azure DevOps, Bitbucket Cloud, Bitbucket Data Center -->

### Changed

### Fixed

## üíª Semgrep Code

### Added

- Added the `--exclude-minified-files` flag to enable skipping minified files and the `--no-exclude-minified-files` flag to include minified files during scans.
- Added `as-metavariable`, which allows rule writers to bind arbitrary matches to a name and then use it with autofixes.
- **Python**: Added support for Flask, Django, and FastAPI.
- Added community support for [Move](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts).
- Added community support for [Circom](https://docs.circom.io/circom-language/signals/).

### Changed

- Improved module resolution for Python scans so that imports like `from a.b import c`, where `c` is a module, resolve correctly.
- Improved error handling for rules with invalid patterns so that scans still complete and findings from other rules are reported.
- **CLI**:
  - Users must sign in before running `semgrep scan --pro`. Scans will not begin until the user signs in.
  - The `--debug` option now displays logging information incrementally instead of waiting for the scan to complete.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where Semgrep Managed Scanning would occasionally hang.
- Fixed an issue where users couldn't pass in the `--junit-xml-output` flag.
- Fixed an issue with the `--pro-intrafile` flag that caused Semgrep to confuse parameters
with top-level functions with no arguments when both share a name:
  ```js
  def foo
    taint
  end

  def bar(foo)
    sink(foo) # no more false positive here
  end
  ```
- Semgrep is stricter when unifying identifiers. For example, this pattern doesn't work because the `foo` methods in classes `A` and `B` aren't the same. As such, their IDs aren't unifiable through `$F`:
  ```yaml
  patterns:
    - pattern-inside: |
        class A:
          ...
          def $F(...):
            ...
          ...
        ...
    - pattern-inside: |
        class B:
          ...
          def $F(...):
            ...
          ...
        ...
  ```
  should be rewritten as follows:
  ```yaml
  patterns:
    - pattern-inside: |
        class A:
          ...
          def $F1(...):
            ...
          ...
        ...
    - pattern-inside: |
        class B:
          ...
          def $F2(...):
            ...
          ...
        ...
    - metavariable-comparison:
        comparison: str($F1) == str($F2)
  ```
- Fixed an issue where code snippets from GitLab-hosted repositories weren't loading.
- **C++**: Fixed an issue so that scanning a project with header files no longer causes spurious warnings that the file is being skipped or isn't being analyzed.
- **CLI**:
  - Fixed an issue where autofix previews weren't displayed with appropriate spacing.
  - Fixed an issue where rules served to the CLI weren't filtered by minimum and maximum versions supported, causing errors.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Semgrep Supply Chain

### Added

- Added support for comparing Go pseudo-versions against other pseudo-versions and strict core versions.
- Added support for uploading and parsing large npm repositories.
- Added the ability to filter findings by EPSS score.
- Added the ability for Supply Chain to retrieve and display CVE data.
- Added a filter to support filtering by reachability rule, CVE, or GHSA information.

### Changed

- SBOMs generated by Semgrep now contain time zone information.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `package-lock.json` parser incorrectly assumed that all paths in the `packages` component of `package-lock.json` started with `node_modules/`. This is incorrect, since a dependency can be installed anywhere. The parser can now recognize alternative locations.
- Fixed an issue where users couldn't create Jira tickets for Supply Chain findings with the severity filter active.
- Fixed an issue where CVE information was labeled as CWE information.

## ü§ñ Semgrep Assistant

### Added

* **Assistant Memories** is now in public beta. [Assistant Memories](/semgrep-assistant/overview#memories-beta) allows users to tailor Assistant's remediation guidance on a per-project, per-rule basis.

### Fixed

- Fixed various UI issues when analyzing findings.

## üîê Semgrep Secrets

### Added

- Added the **Open in Editor** button to the findings detail page for findings identified by Secrets.
- Added the ability to filter for Secrets findings with the status of **Ignored**.
- Added the ability to triage Secrets using the **Reviewing** and **Fixing** statuses.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where Slack webhooks weren't included in historical scan findings.
