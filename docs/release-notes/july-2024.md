# Semgrep release notes for July 2024

## 🌐 Semgrep AppSec Platform

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## 💻 Semgrep Code

### Added

- Added preliminary support for [Move](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts).
- Added the `--exclude-minified-files` flag to skip minified files and the `--no-exclude-minified-files` flag to include minified files. By default, Semgrep scans minified files.

### Changed

- **CLI**:
  - Users must sign in before running `semgrep scan --pro`.
  - The `--debug` option now displays logging information incrementally instead of waiting for the scan to complete.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with the `--pro-intrafile` flag that caused Semgrep to confuse parameters
with top-level functions with no arguments when both share a name:
  ```js
  def foo
    taint
  end

  def bar(foo)
    sink(foo) # no more false positive here
  end
  ```
- Improved module resolution for Python scans so that imports like `from a.b import c`, where `c` is a module, resolve correctly.
- Fixed an issue where Semgrep Managed Scanning would occasionally hang.
- Improved error handling for rules with invalid patterns so that scans still complete and findings from other rules are reported.
- Fixed an issue where users couldn't pass in the `--junit-xml-output` flag.
- Semgrep is stricter when unifying identifiers. For example, this pattern doesn't work because the `foo` methods in classes `A` and `B` aren't the same. As such, their IDs aren't unifiable through `$F`:
  ```yaml
  patterns:
    - pattern-inside: |
        class A:
          ...
          def $F(...):
            ...
          ...
        ...
    - pattern-inside: |
        class B:
          ...
          def $F(...):
            ...
          ...
        ...
  ```
  should be rewritten as follows:
  ```yaml
  patterns:
    - pattern-inside: |
        class A:
          ...
          def $F1(...):
            ...
          ...
        ...
    - pattern-inside: |
        class B:
          ...
          def $F2(...):
            ...
          ...
        ...
    - metavariable-comparison:
        comparison: str($F1) == str($F2)
  ```
- **C++**: Fixed an issue so that scanning a project with header files no longer causes spurious warnings that the file is being skipped or isn't being analyzed.
