# Semgrep release notes for May 2024

## 🌐 Semgrep AppSec Platform

### Added

- **Semgrep managed scanning** is now in public beta. It enables you to scan with Semgrep on any GitHub-hosted repository without the need to change existing CI/CD configurations.
  - Managed scanning is crucial to organizations with hundreds or thousands of repositories. Read the [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> docs](/deployment/managed-scanning) or the [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> blog post](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2024/rapidly-deploy-code-scans-with-semgrep-managed-scanning).

### Changed

- Improved the initial onboarding experience when guiding the user to scan with Semgrep on a remote repository.
- **Projects page**: Improved the **Can't find your project?** tooltip
