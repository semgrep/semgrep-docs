# Semgrep release notes for May 2024

## 🌐 Semgrep AppSec Platform

### Added

- **Semgrep managed scanning** is now in public beta. It enables you to scan with Semgrep on any GitHub-hosted repository without the need to change existing CI/CD configurations.
  - Managed scanning is crucial to organizations with hundreds or thousands of repositories. Read the [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> docs](/deployment/managed-scanning) or the [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> blog post](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2024/rapidly-deploy-code-scans-with-semgrep-managed-scanning).

### Changed

- Improved the onboarding experience when scanning with Semgrep on a remote repository.
- **Projects page**: Improved the **Can't find your project?** tooltip with more troubleshooting advice.
  - The **Sync projects** button has been moved to the **Can't find your project** tooltip.
- Improved Jira integration and workflow. Jira tickets can now be created for Supply Chain findings, and provide better ticket summaries <!-- 14334 --> and descriptions. <!-- 14253 --> See the [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Jira documentation](/semgrep-appsec-platform/jira).

## 💻 Semgrep Code

- The CLI now has the ability to write output to multiple destinations ([Thread](https://semgrepinc.slack.com/archives/C03A5BETNS3/p1714592605202739))
- Code search
- The “Pro-only findings” filter in the Findings page will now filter for both findings originating from Team Tier rules and also findings originating from Pro Engine analysis.

## ⛓️  Semgrep Supply Chain


### Added

- Added public Supply Chain APIs. [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Read the documentation](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/#tag/Finding/operation/semgrep_app.core_exp.findings.handlers.issue.openapi_list_recent_issues).
- Added [lockfile-only support](/supported-languages/#semgrep-supply-chain) for the **Hex package manager** for Elixir codebases.

### Changed

- The Supply Chain UI has been improved for consistency across Semgrep products. With these changes, users are now able to easily manage SCA, SAST, and secret findings. The Supply Chain UI updates provide the following workflow improvements:
  - Grouping vulnerabilities by rule
  - Bulk triaging of findings
  - Comprehensive filtering
  - A unified API for findings across Semgrep Code and Semgrep Supply Chain
