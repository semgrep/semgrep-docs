# Quickstart for Semgrep Managed Scans

This quickstart guide will help you set up Semgrep and scan your first project using Semgrep Managed Scans.

:::info
A **project** is any codebase, repository, or folder within a monorepo that is added to Semgrep for scanning. This includes all the findings, history, and scan metadata for the project.
:::

## What are Semgrep Managed Scans?

Semgrep Managed Scans allow you to run Semgrep scans without needing to set up and maintain your own infrastructure. It provides a simple, scalable way to scan your code for security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and other problems without setting up and maintaining separate configurations for each project.

## Supported source code managers

## Add projects to Semgrep Managed Scans

### Prerequisites

You must have admin access to your Azure DevOps organization.

Read access is granted through an access token you generate on Azure DevOps. You can provide this token by [adding Azure DevOps as a source code manager](/deployment/connect-scm#connect-to-cloud-hosted-orgs).

Semgrep recommends setting up and configuring Semgrep with an Azure DevOps service account, not a personal account. Regardless of whether you use a personal or service account, the account must be assigned the **Owner** or **Project Collection Administrator** role for the organization. During setup and configuration, you must provide a personal access token generated by this account. This token must be authorized with **Full access**. Once you have Semgrep Managed Scans fully configured, you can update the token provided to Semgrep a more restrictive one. The scopes you must assign to the token include:

- `Code: Read`
- `Code: Status`
- `Member Entitlement Management: Read`
- `Project and Team: Read & write`
- `Pull Request Threads: Read & write`

### Add a project

<!-- vale off -->
1. Sign in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login)
2. Navigate to **Projects**, and click **Scan new project > Semgrep Managed Scan**.
3. In the **Enable Managed Scans for repos** page, select the repositories you want to add to Semgrep Managed Scans.
4. Click **Enable Managed Scans**. The **Enable Managed Scans** dialog appears. By default, Semgrep runs both full and diff-aware scans.
5. Click **Enable**. You are taken to the **Projects** page as your scans begin.
<!-- vale on -->

### Prerequisites

You must have admin access to your GitHub organization.

To enable and use this feature, you must grant Semgrep **Read access** to your code. This is done by installing a private GitHub app that you create and register yourself. The steps to do so are provided in the subsequent section of this document. See [Managed Scans > Security](/deployment/managed-scanning/overview#security) for more information on how Semgrep handles your code once you've provided read access.

### Add a project

<!-- vale off -->
<!-- Our in-product text reads "repos" -->

1. Go to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login), and sign up by clicking on **Sign in with GitHub**. Follow the on-screen prompts to [grant Semgrep the necessary permissions](/deployment/checklist/#permissions) and proceed.
1. Provide the **Organization display name** you'd like to use, then click **Create new organization**.
1. When asked **Where do you want to scan?** click **GitHub**.
2. Follow the steps in the **Connect GitHub to Semgrep** page. These steps install a public GitHub app that handles PR comments and a private GitHub app that handles code access. You can select which repositories these apps have access to, and you can remove them or revoke their permissions at any time.
3. Click **Set up projects**. You are taken to the **Enable Managed Scans for repos** page.
4. Select all the repositories you want to add to Semgrep Managed Scans for scanning.
5. Click **Enable Managed Scans**. You are taken to the **Projects** page as your scans begin.

### Prerequisites

You must have admin access to your Bitbucket organization.

#### Bitbucket Cloud

- Read access is granted through a [workspace access token](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/workspace-access-tokens/) you generate on Bitbucket. You can provide this token by [adding Bitbucket as a source code manager](/deployment/connect-scm#connect-to-cloud-hosted-orgs).
- The user generating the workspace token must be a **Product Admin** for the workspace. The scopes you must assign to the token include:
  - `webhook (read and write)`
  - `repository (read and write)`
  - `pullrequest (read and write)`
  - `project (admin)`
  - `account (read)`

#### Bitbucket Data Center

- V8.8 or above for diff-aware scans. Additionally, project-level webhooks are required to support diff-aware scans.
- Read access is granted through an [HTTP access token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/http-access-tokens-939515499.html) you generate on Bitbucket. You can provide this token by [adding Bitbucket as a source code manager](/deployment/connect-scm#connect-to-on-premise-orgs-and-projects).
- The user generating the workspace token must be a **Product Admin** for the workspace. The token must be created with `PROJECT_ADMIN` permissions.

### Add a project

<!-- vale off -->
1. Sign in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login)
2. Navigate to **Projects**, and click **Scan new project > Semgrep Managed Scan**.
3. In the **Enable Managed Scans for repos** page, select the repositories you want to add to Semgrep Managed Scans.
4. Click **Enable Managed Scans**. The **Enable Managed Scans** dialog appears. By default, Semgrep runs both full and diff-aware scans.
5. Click **Enable**. You are taken to the **Projects** page as your scans begin.
<!-- vale on -->

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Semgrep now performs a full scan on all the projects that you added in batches.

You can [view your projects in Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/projects/scanning). All projects with a Managed Scan configuration are tagged with `managed-scan`, regardless of they are actively being scanned by Semgrep Managed Scans.

## Next steps

Once a scan has finished, you can view your findings on the following Semgrep AppSec Platform pages:

- [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i>  Code](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open&primary=true) for SAST findings
- [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Secrets](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/secrets?tab=open&validation_state=confirmed_valid,validation_error,no_validator) for secrets findings
- [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Supply Chain](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/supply-chain/vulnerabilities?primary=true&tab=open) for SCA findings

See [Semgrep Managed Scans](/deployment/managed-scanning/overview) to learn more about how Semgrep manages your scans.
