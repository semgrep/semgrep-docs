Semgrep is a software security tool that provides static application security testing (SAST), software composition analysis (SCA), and secrets detection. It identifies vulnerabilities in source code without executing it. Semgrep integrates with IDEs and CI/CD, and can also run from the Semgrep AppSec Platform.

Semgrep uses rules written in a simple schema that match code semantically. You can use out-of-the-box rules, apply community-maintained rules, or write your own to fit your workflow.

Scan results can be triaged and remediated in the Semgrep AppSec Platform. The platform includes Semgrep Assistant, which offers remediation guidance and autofix suggestions for Semgrep Code and Secrets findings.

## Offerings

* **Community Edition** (CE, open source): the core scanner supporting over programming languages. 
* **Semgrep AppSec Platform** (Pro): managed scanning at org scale, pro rules, supply-chain analysis, secrets detection, PR comments, and AI-assisted triage/fixes, and more. The Semgrep AppSec Platform supports over 35 programming languages, with new ones added regularly.

## The analysis workflow

Semgrep's analysis workflow can be divided into three stages:

### Deployment 
Deployment is the process of integrating Semgrep into your developer and infrastructure workflows. Completing the deployment process provides you with the Semgrep features that meet your security program's needs. Semgrep does not require code access to complete the core deployment process. Your code is **not** sent anywhere.

Learn more about [Semgrep deployment](/docs/deployment/core-deployment)

### Scan

Semgrep offers three products for scanning your code for security vulnerabilities:

* Semgrep Code: a static application security testing (SAST) tool that detects security vulnerabilities in your **first-party code**. You can use it to scan local repositories or integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the continuous scanning of your code. [Learn more](/docs/semgrep-code/overview)

* Semgrep Supply Chain Analysis: a software composition analysis (SCA) tool that detects security vulnerabilities in your codebase introduced by open source dependencies. [Learn more](/docs/semgrep-supply-chain/overview)

* Semgrep Secrets: scans code to detect exposed API keys, passwords, and other credentials. [Learn more](/docs/semgrep-secrets/conceptual-overview)



### Triage and remidiation

After each scan, your findings are displayed in Semgrep AppSec Platform's Secrets page. The filters provided allow you to manage and triage your findings. Additionally, Semgrep Assistant provides AI-powered security recommendations to help you review, triage, and remediate your Semgrep findings.


## Ways to incorporate Semgrep into your development workflow


| Goal | Recommended Option | Available In |
|------|--------------------|---------------|
| Quick local checks | Run Semgrep locally | CE & Pro |
| Catch issues before commit | IDE extension or pre-commit framework | CE & Pro |
| Integrate into builds | CI/CD integration | CE & Pro |
| Org-wide management & automation | Semgrep Managed Scans (SMS) | Pro (AppSec Platform) only |



### Run Semgrep locally

Run Semgrep directly on your machine to scan code before pushing changes. This is the quickest way to get started and experiment with rules. You can run scans manually from the command line or set up local automations.  
[Learn more about running Semgrep locally](/docs/getting-started/quickstart).


### Use Semgrep in your IDE or before commits

Incorporate Semgrep early in your development workflow by using a [supported IDE extension](/docs/extensions/overview#official-ide-extensions) or by setting up the [pre-commit framework](/docs/extensions/pre-commit), which runs Semgrep checks automatically before code is committed. This helps you catch issues before they ever reach your repository.



### Add Semgrep to CI/CD

Integrate Semgrep into your CI/CD environment (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, CircleCI, Azure Pipelines, Bitbucket, or Buildkite) by creating a job that your CI provider runs. After each scan, findings are sent to the Semgrep AppSec Platform for triage and remediation.  
[Learn more](/docs/deployment/add-semgrep-to-ci).

> **Note:** While CI/CD integration continues to be supported, [Semgrep Managed Scans](#4-semgrep-managed-scans-via-the-appsec-platform-dashboard-recommended) are the recommended approach for organization-wide deployments.



### Semgrep Managed Scans (SMS) via the AppSec Platform Dashboard (Recommended)

[Semgrep Managed Scans](/docs/deployment/managed-scanning/overview) help teams adopt SAST, SCA, and secrets detection tools across their organization without complex setup. Scans are run automatically on Semgrepâ€™s cloud infrastructure, and results appear directly in the AppSec Platform dashboard.

**Key features:**
- Minimal setup and no CI changes required  
- Configure scans through the AppSec Platform  
- Scan multiple repositories with a single integration  
- Integrate results into workflows via PR comments  
- Available for all Semgrep products (Code, Secrets, Supply Chain Analysis)  
- Automatic bi-weekly scans  



## Why Semgrep beats typical competitors (practical differences)

* No build prerequisite for most languages: easier to run on any repo; CodeQL generally requires a buildable environment and its own query DSL. 
* Faster rule authoring and iteration: patterns mirror code; fewer context switches than writing QL queries. 
* Immediate PR/MR feedback with organization-tuned policies: developers fix or ignore in review; less triage churn. 
* Clear path to deeper analysis without leaving the workflow (cross-file/taint, reachability, secrets/SCA) when using the platform features. 

**Net effect** -- Lower setup friction, fewer false positives in code review, simpler custom rules, and a tighter loop between security and developers.
