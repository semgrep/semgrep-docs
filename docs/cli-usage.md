# CLI reference

The following usage documentation is for the [Semgrep command line tool](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep).

## Command-line options

See `semgrep --help` for command line options.

```sh
Usage: semgrep [OPTIONS] [TARGET]...

  Semgrep CLI. Searches TARGET paths for matches to rules or patterns. Defaults to
  searching entire current working directory.

  To get started quickly, run

      semgrep --config auto .

  This will automatically fetch rules for your project from the Semgrep Registry. NOTE:
  Using `--config auto` will log in to the Semgrep Registry with your project URL.

  For more information about Semgrep, go to https://semgrep.dev.

  NOTE: By default, Semgrep will report pseudonymous usage metrics to its server if you
  pull your configuration from the Semgrep registy. To learn more about how and why
  these metrics are collected, please see
  https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/PRIVACY.md. To modify this behavior, see the
  --metrics option below.

Options:
  -a, --autofix / --no-autofix    Apply autofix patches. WARNING: data loss can occur
                                  with this flag. Make sure your files are stored in a
                                  version control system. Note that this mode is
                                  experimental and not guaranteed to function properly.
  --replacement TEXT              An autofix expression that will be applied to any
                                  matches found with --pattern. Only valid with a
                                  command-line specified pattern.
  --error / --no-error            Exit 1 if there are findings. Useful for CI and
                                  scripts.
  -l, --lang TEXT                 Parse pattern and all files in specified language.
                                  Must be used with -e/--pattern.
  --metrics [auto|on|off]         Configures how usage metrics are sent to the Semgrep
                                  server. If 'auto', metrics are sent whenever the
                                  --config value pulls from the Semgrep server. If 'on',
                                  metrics are always sent. If 'off', metrics are
                                  disabled altogether and not sent. If absent, the
                                  SEMGREP_SEND_METRICS environment variable value will
                                  be used. If no environment variable, defaults to
                                  'auto'.
  --severity [INFO|WARNING|ERROR]
                                  Report findings only from rules matching the supplied
                                  severity level. By default all applicable rules are
                                  run.Can add multiple times. Each should be one of
                                  INFO, WARNING, or ERROR.
  --strict / --no-strict          Return a nonzero exit code when WARN level errors are
                                  encountered. Fails early if invalid configuration
                                  files are present. Defaults to --no-strict.
  Configuration options: [mutually_exclusive]
    -c, -f, --config TEXT         YAML configuration file, directory of YAML files
                                  ending in .yml|.yaml, URL of a configuration file, or
                                  Semgrep registry entry name.
                                  
                                  Use --config auto to automatically obtain rules
                                  tailored to this project; your project URL will be
                                  used to log in to the Semgrep registry.
                                  
                                  See https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/rule-syntax
                                  for information on configuration file format.
    -e, --pattern TEXT            Code search pattern. See
                                  https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/pattern-syntax
                                  for information on pattern features.
  Alternate modes:                No search is performed in these modes
    --validate                    Validate configuration file(s). No search is
                                  performed.
    --version                     Show the version and exit.
  Path options:                   By default, Semgrep scans all git-tracked files with
                                  extensions matching rules' languages. These options
                                  alter which files Semgrep scans.
    --exclude TEXT                Skip any file or directory that matches this pattern;
                                  --exclude='*.py' will ignore the following: foo.py,
                                  src/foo.py, foo.py/bar.sh. --exclude='tests' will
                                  ignore tests/foo.py as well as a/b/tests/c/foo.py. Can
                                  add multiple times. If present, any --include
                                  directives are ignored.
    --include TEXT                Filter files or directories by path. The argument is a
                                  glob-style pattern such as 'foo.*' that must match the
                                  path. This is an extra filter in addition to other
                                  applicable filters. For example, specifying the
                                  language with '-l javascript' might preselect files
                                  'src/foo.jsx' and 'lib/bar.js'. Specifying one of '--
                                  include=src', '--include=*.jsx', or '--
                                  include=src/foo.*' will restrict the selection to the
                                  single file 'src/foo.jsx'. A choice of multiple '--
                                  include' patterns can be specified. For example, '--
                                  include=foo.* --include=bar.*' will select both
                                  'src/foo.jsx' and 'lib/bar.js'. Glob-style patterns
                                  follow the syntax supported by python, which is
                                  documented at
                                  https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html
    --max-target-bytes BYTES      Maximum size for a file to be scanned by Semgrep, e.g
                                  '1.5MB'. Any input program larger than this will be
                                  ignored. A zero or negative value disables this
                                  filter. Defaults to 1000000 bytes.
    --use-git-ignore / --no-git-ignore
                                  Skip files ignored by git. Scanning starts from the
                                  root folder specified on the Semgrep command line.
                                  Normally, if the scanning root is within a git
                                  repository,  only the tracked files and the new files
                                  would be scanned. Git submodules and git-ignored files
                                  would normally be skipped. --no-git-ignore will
                                  disable git-aware filtering. Setting this flag does
                                  nothing if the scanning root is not in a git
                                  repository.
    --scan-unknown-extensions / --skip-unknown-extensions
                                  If true, explicit files will be scanned using the
                                  language specified in --lang. If --skip-unknown-
                                  extensions, these files will not be scanned
  Performance and memory options: 
    --enable-version-check / --disable-version-check
                                  Checks Semgrep servers to see if the latest version is
                                  run; disabling this may reduce exit time after
                                  returning results.
    -j, --jobs INTEGER            Number of subprocesses to use to run checks in
                                  parallel. Defaults to the number of cores on the
                                  system.
    --max-memory INTEGER          Maximum system memory to use running a rule on a
                                  single file in MB. If set to 0 will not have memory
                                  limit. Defaults to 0.
    --optimizations [all|none]    Turn on/off optimizations. Default = 'all'. Use 'none'
                                  to turn all optimizations off.
    --timeout INTEGER             Maximum time to spend running a rule on a single file
                                  in seconds. If set to 0 will not have time limit.
                                  Defaults to 30 s.
    --timeout-threshold INTEGER   Maximum number of rules that can timeout on a file
                                  before the file is skipped. If set to 0 will not have
                                  limit. Defaults to 0.
  Display options: 
    --enable-nosem / --disable-nosem
                                  --enable-nosem enables 'nosem'. Findings will not be
                                  reported on lines containing a 'nosem' comment at the
                                  end. Enabled by default.
    --force-color / --no-force-color
                                  Always include ANSI color in the output, even if not
                                  writing to a TTY; defaults to using the TTY status
    --max-chars-per-line INTEGER  Maximum number of characters to show per line.
    --max-lines-per-finding INTEGER
                                  Maximum number of lines of code that will be shown for
                                  each match before trimming (set to 0 for unlimited).
    -o, --output TEXT             Save search results to a file or post to URL. Default
                                  is to print to stdout.
    --rewrite-rule-ids / --no-rewrite-rule-ids
                                  Rewrite rule ids when they appear in nested sub-
                                  directories (Rule 'foo' in test/rules.yaml will be
                                  renamed 'test.foo').
    --time / --no-time            Include a timing summary with the resultsIf output
                                  format is json, provides times for each pair (rule,
                                  target).
  Output formats: [mutually_exclusive]
                                  Uses ASCII output if no format specified.
    --emacs                       Output results in Emacs single-line format.
    --json                        Output results in JSON format.
    --junit-xml                   Output results in JUnit XML format.
    --sarif                       Output results in SARIF format.
    --vim                         Output results in vim single-line format.
  Verbosity options: [mutually_exclusive]
    -q, --quiet                   Only output findings.
    -v, --verbose                 Show more details about what rules are running, which
                                  files failed to parse, etc.
    --debug                       All of --verbose, but with additional debugging
                                  information.
  Test and debug options: 
    --test                        Run test suite.
    --test-ignore-todo / --no-test-ignore-todo
                                  If --test-ignore-todo, ignores rules marked as
                                  '#todoruleid:' in test files.
    --dump-ast / --no-dump-ast    If --dump-ast, shows AST of the input file or passed
                                  expression and then exit (can use --json).
    --dryrun / --no-dryrun        If --dryrun, does not write autofixes to a file. This
                                  will print the changes to the console. This lets you
                                  see the changes before you commit to them. Only works
                                  with the --autofix flag. Otherwise does nothing.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

## Exit codes

`semgrep` may exit with the following exit codes:

- `0`: Semgrep ran successfully and found no errors (or did find errors, but the `--error` flag is *not* set)
- `1`: Semgrep ran successfully and found issues in your code (and the `--error` flag is set)
- `2`: Semgrep failed
- `3`: Semgrep failed to parse a file in the specified language
- `4`: Semgrep encountered an invalid pattern
- `5`: Semgrep config is not valid yaml
- `6`: Rule with `pattern-where-python` found but `--dangerously-allow-arbitrary-code-execution-from-rules` was not set. See `--dangerously-allow-arbitrary-code-execution-from-rules`.
- `7`: All rules in config are invalid. If semgrep is run with `--strict` then this exit code is returned when any rule in the configs are invalid.
- `8`: Semgrep does not understand specified language
- `9`: Semgrep exceeded match timeout. See `--timeout`
- `10`: Semgrep exceeded max memory while matching. See `--max-memory`.
- `11`: Semgrep encountered a lexical error when running rule on a file.
