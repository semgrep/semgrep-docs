title: Command Injection Prevention for Go
summary: |-
  This is a command injection prevention cheat sheet by r2c.
  It contains code patterns of potential ways to run an OS commands or code in an application.
  Instead of scrutinizing code for exploitable vulnerabilities,
  the recommendations in this cheat sheet pave a safe road for developers that mitigates the possibility of Command injection in your code.
  By following these recommendations, you can be reasonably sure your code is free of command injection.
mitigation_summary: |-
  In general, try not to let dynamic content in APIs intended for OS command execution.
  If this is not an option then perform proper input validation and contextually escape user data.

          <code>Command</code> and <code>CommandContext</code> return the Cmd struct to execute the named program with the given arguments.
          If unverified user data can reach its call site, this may end up in a command injection vulnerability.
          Both <code>Command</code> and <code>CommandContext</code> have built-in protections that will not let command arguments cause trouble.
          But make sure that the command itself is not controlled by the user, also do not use <code>sh</code>,
          because internal protection will not work in this case.
        example: |+
          package main

          import "os/exec"

          func main() {
            // Command example
            cmd := exec.Command("echo", "hello")

            // CommandContext is like Command but includes a context.
            err := exec.CommandContext(ctx, "sleep", "5").Run()

            // Not vulnerable
            cmd := exec.Command("echo", "1; cat /etc/passwd")

            // Vunerable
            out, _ = exec.Command("sh", "-c", "echo 1 | cat /etc/passwd").Output()

            // Vulnerable
            userInput1 = "cat" // value supplied by user input
            userInput2 = "/etc/passwd" // value supplied by user input
            out, _ = exec.Command(userInput1, userInput2)
