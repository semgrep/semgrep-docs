## 1. Running OS commands

### 1.A. Running code with Open3 module

`Open3` grants access to running processes when running another program. For more information, see [Ruby documentation](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Open3.html). Such methods as `capture2`, `capture2e`, `capture3`, `popen2`, `popen2e`, `popen3`, `pipeline`, `pipeline_r`, `pipeline_rw`, `pipeline_start` and `pipeline_w` are intended for running commands provided as a string. Letting user supplied data in a command that is passed as an argument to one of these methods, can create an opportunity for a command injection vulnerability.

Example:

```ruby
require 'open3'

# safe
Open3.popen3("ls -la")

# vulnerable
user_input = "  && cat /etc/passwd" # Value supplied by user
Open3.popen3("ls #{user_input}")
```

```ruby
require 'open3'

# safe
fname = "/usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz"
Open3.pipeline(["zcat", fname], "nroff -man", "colcrt")

# vulnerable
user_input = "  && cat /etc/passwd" # Value supplied by user
Open3.pipeline("zcat #{user_input}”, "nroff -man", "colcrt")
```

#### Mitigation

- Do not pass user input to `Open3` methods.
- Always try to use internal Ruby API (if it exists) instead of running an OS command. In other words, use internal language features instead of invoking commands that can be exploited.
- Don’t pass user-controlled input or use an allowlist for inputs.
- Do not include command arguments in a command string, use parameterization instead. For example:<br />
    Use:
    ```ruby
    Open3.pipeline(["/path/to/myCommand", "myArg1", input_value])
    ```
    Instead of:
    ```ruby
    Open3.pipeline(["bash", "-c", "myCommand myArg1 " + input_value])
    ```
- Define a list of allowed arguments.
- Avoid non-literal values for the command string. Strip everything except alphanumeric characters from an input provided for the command string and arguments.

### 1.B. Using open() to run subprocesses

The `open(...)` creates an input/output (I/O) object connected to a stream, file, or subprocess. If the first argument starts with a pipe character (`|`), it creates a subprocess. An opportunity for command injection vulnerability is created when the subprocess includes user input in a command argument to `open()` function.

Example:

```ruby
# safe
open("my_file.txt")

# vulnerable
user_input = “|cat /etc/passwd” # Value supplied by user
open(user_input)
```

#### Mitigation

- Do not provide raw user input to `open` methods.
- Always try to use internal Ruby API (if it exists) instead of running an OS command. In other words, use internal language features instead of invoking commands that can be exploited.
- Don’t pass user-controlled input or use an allowlist for inputs.
- Define a list of allowed arguments.
- Strip everything except alphanumeric characters from an input provided for the command string and arguments.
