# Semgrep MCP Server

Semgrep's open source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enables you to scan for security vulnerabilities.

Semgrep is a fast, deterministic static analysis tool that semantically understands many [languages](https://semgrep.dev/docs/supported-languages) and comes with over [5,000 rules](https://semgrep.dev/registry). [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is a standardized API for LLMs, Agents, and IDEs like Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, or any tool that supports MCP to receive specialized help, gain context, and harness the power of tools.

Semgrep's open source MCP works with any IDE-based MCP client, enabling LLMs to use Semgrep to find and fix security issues in the code they generate.
