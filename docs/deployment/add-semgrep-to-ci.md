# Add Semgrep to CI

:::note Your deployment journey
- You have gained the necessary [resource access and permissions](/deployment/checklist) required for deployment.
- You have [created a Semgrep account and organization](/deployment/create-account-and-orgs). 
- For GitHub and GitLab users: You have [connected your source code manager](/deployment/connect-scm).
- Optionally, you have [set up SSO](/deployment/sso).
:::

Semgrep is integrated into CI environments by creating a **job** that is run by the CI provider. After a scan, findings are sent to Semgrep Cloud Platform (SCP) for triage and remediation. 

By integrating Semgrep into your CI environment, your development cycle benefits from the automated scanning of repositories at various events, such as:

- Push events
- Pull or merge requests (PRs or MRs)
- User-initiated events (such as GitHub Action's `workflow_dispatch`)

## Guided setup for CI providers in SCP

This guide walks you through creating a Semgrep job in the following CI providers, which are explicitly supported in SCP:

- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI/CD
- Jenkins
- Bitbucket
- CircleCI
- Buildkite
- Azure Pipelines

![CI providers explicitly supported in SCP.](/img/in-app-providers.png#bordered)
**Figure**. Semgrep Cloud Platform provides steps and configuration files to easily set up a Semgrep job for popular CI providers.

If your provider is **not** on this list, you can still integrate Semgrep into your CI workflows by following the steps in [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Add Semgrep to other CI providers](/deployment/add-semgrep-to-other-ci-providers).

## Projects

Adding a Semgrep job to your CI provider also adds the repository's records, including findings, as a **project** in Semgrep Cloud Platform. Each Project can be individually configured to send notifications or tickets. 

![Semgrep Cloud Platform Projects page](/img/projects-page.png)
**Figure.** Semgrep Cloud Platform Projects page. This displays all the repositories you have successfully added a Semgrep job to.

## Add Semgrep to CI through Semgrep Cloud Platform

<Tabs
    defaultValue="other"
    values={[
    {label: 'SCP-supported CI providers', value: 'other'},
    {label: 'GitHub Actions', value: 'gha'},
    ]}
>

<TabItem value='gha'>

To add a CI job to GitHub Actions:

1. Ensure you are signed in to Semgrep Cloud Platform.
1. Click **[Projects](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/projects)** on the left sidebar.
1. Click **Scan new project > CI/CD**.
1. Click **GitHub Actions**.
1. A list of repositories appears. Select all the repositories you want to add a Semgrep job to.
1. If you do not see the repository you want to add, adjust [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> GitHub Application's Repository Access](https://github.com/settings/installations) configuration. See [Detecting GitHub repositories](#detecting-github-repositories) for more information.
1. Click **Add CI job**. You are taken to the Add CI job page.
1. Optional: Click **Review CI config** to see Semgrep's default YAML configuration file. 
1. Click **Commit file**.

You have now added a Semgrep job to GitHub Actions. A scan begins automatically after adding a new repository. Its findings are sent to Semgrep Cloud Platform for triage and remediation.

:::tip
You can edit your configuration files to send findings to **GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard (GHAS)** and **GitLab SAST Dashboard**. Refer to the following samples:
- [GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard](/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#upload-findings-to-github-advanced-security-dashboard)
- [GitLab SAST Dashboard](/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#upload-findings-to-gitlab-security-dashboard)

### Sample CI configuration snippets

Refer to the following table for links to sample CI configuration snippets:

| In-app CI provider   | Sample CI configuration snippet |
| :------------------- | :-----------------------------  |
| GitHub Actions       |  [`semgrep.yml`](/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#github-actions) |
| GitLab CI/CD         | [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#gitlab-cicd) |
| Jenkins              | [`Jenkinsfile`](/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#jenkins) |
| Bitbucket Pipelines  | [`bitbucket-pipelines.yml`](/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#bitbucket-pipelines) |
| CircleCI             | [`config.yml`](/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#circleci) |
| Buildkite            | [`pipelines.yml`](/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#buildkite) |
| Azure Pipelines      | [`azure-pipelines.yml`](/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#azure-pipelines) |

### Data collected by Semgrep Cloud Platform

When running in CI, Semgrep runs fully in the CI build environment. Unless you have explicitly granted code access to Semgrep, your code is not sent anywhere.

- Semgrep Cloud Platform collects [findings data](/semgrep-ci/findings-ci/), which includes the line number of the code match, but not the code. It is hashed using a one-way hashing function.
- Findings data is used to generate line-specific hyperlinks to your source code management system and support other Semgrep functions.
