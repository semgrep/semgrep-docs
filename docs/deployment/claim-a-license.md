# Claim a license

Once you've purchased a subscription, you should receive an email from Semgrep with your license information. Follow the instructions provided in the email to claim your license and begin onboarding your Semgrep products.

If you have been provided a license key by Semgrep or if you would like to claim a license manually:

1. Sign up or log in to your Semgrep account.
2. [Create an org](/docs/deployment/create-account-and-orgs/#initial-sign-in-to-semgrep-appsec-platform) if you haven't already done so.
3. Navigate to `http://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/upgrade/YOUR_LICENSE_KEY`, making sure that you **replace** the `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` placeholder with your license key value.
