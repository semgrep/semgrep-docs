# Add repositories to Semgrep in bulk

**Semgrep cloud scanning** enables you to add repositories to your Semgrep org in bulk without adding or changing your CI workflows.

This is an alternative method to [adding Semgrep in CI](/deployment/add-semgrep-to-ci). Instead of adding a Semgrep job or workflow to your CI/CD pipeline, repositories are instead added to Semgrep AppSec Platform.

## Feature maturity

- Cloud scanning is in **public beta**.
- tk how to leave feedback

## Requirements

- Cloud scanning **requires code access**.
- Only GitHub.com (hosted GitHub accounts) tk
