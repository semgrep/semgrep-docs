# Beyond core deployment

Now that you've finished your Semgrep core deployment, you can either customize Semgrep's scan behavior or further integrate additional deployment features. The following sections list common post-deployment tasks.

## Customizing Semgrep scans

| Concern | Guide |
| -------  | ------ |
| Semgrep Code scans irrelevant files.         | Ignore files.  |
| Semgrep Code is too noisy.         | Enable Semgrep Pro Engine.  |
| I want my developers to see certain security issues in their pull or merge requests.         | Configure your policies.  |
| I want to prevent developers from using certain licenses. | |
| I want to receive assistance when I triage findings. | |

## Additional deployment

| Concern | Guide |
| -------  | ------ |
| I want to receive notifications in my environment.         |   |
| I want my developers to use Semgrep on their IDE.         |   |
| I'm scanning too many codebases with Semgrep and want to group them somehow.         |   |
