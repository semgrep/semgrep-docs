# Manage projects

View, sort, and tag your projects through the **Projects** page. A **project** is any repository that you have scanned with Semgrep AppSec Platform through CI or Semgrep Managed Scans, and includes that repository's findings and metadata.

Refer to this page to **manage** and **troubleshoot** thousands of repositories by identifying scan issues or scans with a high finding count.

Each project has its own **Project detail** page, where you can filter scans, configure settings, and view detailed logs for each scan that has been run.

Use the **Project detail** page to:

- View trends over time, such as longer or shorter scan durations.
- Share information when troubleshooting scans through the **Scans** tab.
- Update a project's tags, primary branch, and path ignores through the **Settings** tab.

Additionally, the Semgrep API enables you to filter tags for additional workflows and integrations into your own systems. Create tags based on engineering or department teams, external-facing or internal codebases, and so on. See [Tags](/semgrep-appsec-platform/tags) for more information.

## Sort projects

View all projects by navigating to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login) and clicking **<i class="fa-solid fa-folder-open"></i> Projects**.

To sort projects, click the attribute you want to sort by on the header row. You can only sort by one attribute.

Sort by the following attributes:

- **Project**: Click to toggle between sorting project names alphabetically in ascending or descending order. 
- **Last scan**: Click to toggle between sorting the projects' latest scans in ascending or descending order. The sorting is based on when the last scan **started**, regardless of its status. For this reason, you may see that scans with statuses such as **Not started** or **Never finished** are not necessarily grouped together.

## Filter a project's scans

1. Navigate to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login) and click **<i class="fa-solid fa-folder-open"></i> Projects**.
1. In the row of the project you want to view, click the project's **<i class="far fa-window-restore"></i> window icon** under the **Details** column.

The following filters are available:

- **Time period**: 7 days or 1 month
- **Scan type**: Full or diff-aware scans
- **Status**: Running, completed, error, or never finished
- **Duration**: The amount of time the scan took to complete in hours or minutes

:::note
Scan details, such as logs, are available for scans run in the past **1 month**. Semgrep AppSec Platform does not display scan details older than 30 days, since this introduces performance issues due to the increased volume of stored scan data.

## Scan details and logs

To view the latest scan's details from the Projects page:

1. Hover over the project's latest scan status. This displays the **<i class="fa-solid fa-sidebar-flip"></i> Drawer icon**.

1. Click the **<i class="fa-solid fa-sidebar-flip"></i> icon** to view the scan details drawer. This drawer displays both an **overview** of the scan and **CI or Managed Scan logs**. Local scans do not have a **Logs** tab. 

### Permalinks to scan details

You can link to a specific scan's details to send to your colleagues for collaboration or troubleshooting. Click the **<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> link icon** on the header to copy the permalink.
