Semgrep can be set up to scan repositories of any size.

**Deployment** refers to the process of integrating Semgrep into your developer and infrastructure workflows. Completing the deployment process provides you with the Semgrep features that meet your security program's needs.

Deployment includes:

- Running Semgrep scanners as part of your CI. These scans can be any combination of SAST (Static Application Security Testing), SCA (Software Composition Analysis), or Secrets, depending on your plan.
- Managing team members' access and authentication.
- Ensuring that Semgrep has sufficient access to your self-hosted source code manager (SCM), such as GitLab Self-Managed.

Semgrep does not require code access to complete the core deployment process. Your code is not sent anywhere. 

:::tip Are these guides for you?
- These guides outline procedures for the deployment of Semgrep as part of a security program. To try out Semgrep, refer to the [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) document.
- Individual users can also use these guides to deploy Semgrep as part of their personal security.
:::

Many deployment features are set up through **Semgrep AppSec Platform**.

Deployment does **not** include:

- Customizing your SAST, SCA, or secrets scans
- Custom rule writing
- Triage

For these features, refer to the **Scan and Triage** section in the navigation bar.

### All Semgrep deployment features

Semgrep supports many different technology stacks. Refer to the following table to evaluate which deployment features of Semgrep you can use based on your technologies.

#### Additional deployment features

Useful features that you can add based on your tech stack. You can integrate these features further into your security workflows after some initial testing of your core deployment.

## Core deployment process

At the minimum, your deployment of Semgrep consists of the following steps:

1. **Creating a Semgrep account**. Each user of Semgrep has one account.
1. **Setting up organizations (orgs)**. Each Semgrep account can have many orgs. Orgs are logical groupings of related repositories and users.
1. **Setting up membership**:
    - For GitHub or GitLab users, you can connect your Semgrep org to the orgs in your source code manager (SCM). This means that any member of an org in your SCM can sign in to your Semgrep deployment.
    - You can also use SSO to manage user authentication.
1. **Adding Semgrep into your CI workflows**. This step ensures that your Semgrep deployment is up and running and that you receive **findings** of security issues in Semgrep AppSec Platform.
1. **Enabling Semgrep to post PR or MR comments**.

![Core deployment steps](/img/core-deployment.png#sm-width-noborder)

To manage a large volume of users and repositories, you may need to perform additional steps:

- Role management
- Tagging projects

These steps are covered in the section [Deployment at scale](/category/deployment-at-scale).

Team size isn't necessarily indicative of deployment needs. Features for large teams can be deployed for smaller teams as well, and are available on the Semgrep Team Tier.

## Deploy Semgrep in phases

It is recommended to finish the core deployment of Semgrep to a few repositories or departments in your organization first before attempting to deploy to the majority.

This **initial phase** prepares you to deploy Semgrep to the rest of the organization. Organizational infrastructure can vary greatly and the initial deployment can help you identify and address issues so that they do not recur in a wider deployment.
