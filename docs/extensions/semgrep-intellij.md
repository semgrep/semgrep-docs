# Semgrep IntelliJ extension

[Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) accelerates your security journey by swiftly scanning code and package dependencies for known issues, software vulnerabilities, and detected secrets with unparalleled efficiency. By default, the Semgrep IntelliJ extension scans code whenever you change or open files.

## Prerequisites

Semgrep IntelliJ extension communicates with Semgrep command-line interface (CLI) to run scans. Install Semgrep CLI before you can use the extension. To install Semgrep CLI:

```sh
# For macOS
$ brew install semgrep

# For Ubuntu/WSL/Linux/macOS
$ python3 -m pip install semgrep

# To try Semgrep without installation run via Docker
$ docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/src" returntocorp/semgrep semgrep
```

## Quick start

1. Install the Semgrep extension
*  Visit [Semgrep's page on the Jet Brains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22622-semgrep).
*  In IntelliJ: Settings/Preferences > Plugins > Marketplace > Search for `semgrep-intellij` > Install. 
* You may need to restart IntelliJ for the Semgrep extension to be installed.

2. Sign in: Press <kbd>Ctrl+⇧Shift+A</kbd> or <kbd>⌘Command+⇧Shift+A</kbd> (macOS) and sign in to Semgrep Cloud Platform by selecting the following command:

## Commands

Run Semgrep extension commands through the IntelliJ Command Palette. You can access the Command Palette by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+⇧Shift+A</kbd> or <kbd>⌘Command+⇧Shift+A</kbd> (macOS) on your keyboard. 

- `Sign in with Semgrep`: Sign in or log in to the Semgrep Cloud Platform (this command opens a new window in your browser). When you sign in, you can automatically scan with Semgrep [Code](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-code/), [Supply Chain](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-supply-chain/), and [Secrets](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-secrets/). Alternatively, you can log in through your command-line interface by running `semgrep login`.
- `Sign out of Semgrep`: Log out of Semgrep Cloud Platform. If you are logged out, you lose access to Semgrep Supply Chain and Semgrep Secrets. Alternatively, you can sign out through your command-line interface by running `semgrep logout`.
- `Scan workspace with Semgrep`: Scan files that have been changed since the last commit in your current workspace.
- `Scan workspace with Semgrep (Including Unmodified Files)`: Scan all files in the current workspace.
