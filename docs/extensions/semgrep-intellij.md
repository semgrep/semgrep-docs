# Semgrep IntelliJ extension

[Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) swiftly scans code and package dependencies for known issues, software vulnerabilities, and detected secrets. Run Semgrep in your developer environment with the IntelliJ extension to catch code issues as you type. By default, the Semgrep IntelliJ extension scans code whenever you change or open files.

:::info Prerequisites

The Semgrep IntelliJ extension communicates with Semgrep command-line interface (CLI) to run scans. Install Semgrep CLI before you can use the extension. To install Semgrep CLI:

```sh
# For macOS
$ brew install semgrep

# For Ubuntu/WSL/Linux/macOS
$ python3 -m pip install semgrep
```
:::

## Quick start

1. Install the Semgrep extension:
   -  Visit [Semgrep's page on the JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22622-semgrep).
   -  In IntelliJ: **Settings/Preferences > Plugins > Marketplace > Search for `semgrep-intellij` > Install**. You may need to restart IntelliJ for the Semgrep extension to be installed.

2. Sign in: Press <kbd>Ctrl+⇧Shift+A</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>⌘Command+⇧Shift+A</kbd> (macOS) and sign in to Semgrep Cloud Platform by selecting the following command:
   ```
   Sign in with Semgrep
   ```
3. Test the extension by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+⇧Shift+A</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>⌘Command+⇧Shift+A</kbd> (macOS) and run the following command:
   ```
   Scan workspace with Semgrep
   ```
4. See Semgrep findings: Hold the pointer over the code that has the red underline.

Please join the [Semgrep community Slack workspace](http://go.semgrep.dev/slack) and let the Semgrep team know if you encounter any issues.
