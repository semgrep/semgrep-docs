# Extensions

Several third-party tools include Semgrep extensions.

## Official IDE extensions

<IdeList />

## Use of Language Server Protocol (LSP)

All of the official IDE extensions use the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) to communicate with Semgrep. This allows the team to focus on one codebase that can be shared across most modern editor platforms.

## `pre-commit`

Prevent secrets or security issues from entering your Git source control history by running Semgrep as a [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook. See [`pre-commit` documentation](/extensions/pre-commit) for details.

## Semgrep as an engine

Many other tools have capabilities powered by Semgrep.
