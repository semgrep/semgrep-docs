# Semgrep integration guide for partners


### Introduction

We're excited that you're integrating Semgrep into your tooling! Our goal with Semgrep is to bring world-class security tools to developers based on our conviction that software will run the most exciting parts of the future. It's not something that we can do alone; we want to build a community around sharing programmatic knowledge about how to build secure software.


### Requirements for Integrators

* Do not resell rules from the registry, unless you acquire an explicit license from Semgrep, Inc. Semgrep rules are [released under the Commons Clause License](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules/blob/develop/LICENSE), which prohibits redistribution in a commercial product.
* State that you are using Semgrep; refer to Semgrep as capital S with the trademark: Semgrep™
* Link to [semgrep.dev/login](https://semgrep.dev/login) to allow users to get an API token to pass to Semgrep so they can access the Pro Engine and rules.
* Set `SEMGREP_INTEGRATION_NAME `in your environment to your domain name (e.g. "xyz.com" – this helps us reproduce & debug issues with Semgrep in your environment.
* Don't integrate `semgrep scan` in a CI setup. Instead use `semgrep ci`, which has diff-awareness built-in and is designed to be easy to integrate into dozens of CI environments (it's also much faster).
* We require enabling metrics (`--metrics=on`) by default, which lets Semgrep prioritize languages and technologies to improve speed and accuracy on.
* Contribute new public rules back to the [semgrep-rules repository](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules). This helps us avoid community fragmentation and will automatically pull your rule into the searchable registry on semgrep.dev; plus Semgrep will maintain it for you!

For more information about licensing, please refer to [this section](licensing.md) in our documentation. If you have additional questions, you can email us at [partners@semgrep.com](mailto:partners@semgrep.com).
