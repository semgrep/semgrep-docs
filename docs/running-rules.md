# Running rules

## Introduction

Rules are specific patterns based on which Semgrep reports findings in code. These findings may help you to catch issues of security, performance, correctness, and other bugs. Rules are stored in open-source Semgrep Registry that enables you to scan code without need to write anything custom.

Contribute to the registry by writing your own rules and adding them to the <a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules" target="_blank">Semgrep rules repository</a>.

</div>

You can run existing and custom Semgrep rules locally with the Semrgep command line tool or continuously with Semgrep CI. See [Getting started](../getting-started/) for their respective installation and setup.

## Run Registry rules

Explore the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) and run rules and rulesets via:

```sh
# Automatically survey languages and frameworks and run recommended Registry rules
semgrep --config=auto path/to/src

# Run a ruleset with rules for many languages using --config
semgrep --config=<ruleset-id> path/to/src

# Run simultaneously with Registry rulesets and local rules
semgrep --config=<ruleset-id> --config=path/to/yml path/to/src
```

When the Registry is used, [usage metrics](../metrics) are collected.

Rulesets can be added to Semgrep CI scans using their "Add to Policy" button on Semgrep Community and Semgrep Team.

## Run local rules

Local rules can be either:

- Ephemeral rules with the `-e` or `--pattern` flags for use in a single command.
- Configured in YAML rule files that conform to the [Rule syntax](../writing-rules/rule-syntax/) schema.

See [Writing rules > Getting started](../writing-rules/overview/) to learn how to write rules.

### Ephemeral rules

Use the `-e` or `--pattern` flags in your terminal for ephemeral rules that are used once.

For example: Check for Python `==` where the left and right sides are the same (often a bug): 
```sh
semgrep -e '$X == $X' --lang=py path/to/src
```

### YAML-defined rules

Create a YAML rule file that you can run repeatedly.

1. Create a `rule.yaml` file.
2. Below is a simple example rule for Python which you can paste into your `rule.yaml` file.
    ```yaml
    rules:
    - id: is-comparison
      languages:
        - python
      message: The operator 'is' is for reference equality, not value equality! Use
      `==` instead!
      pattern: $SOMEVAR is "..."
      severity: ERROR
    ```
    See [Getting started](../writing-rules/overview/) for the full example.
3. Run the following command to run local YAML rule files:
    ```sh
    semgrep --config path/to/rule.yaml
    ```

### Running multiple rules simultaneously

To run multiple rules simultaneously, use `--config` before every YAML URL, or Semgrep registry entry name. See the following code example (substitute the colored values as necessary):

<pre class="language-bash"><code>semgrep --config <span className="placeholder">p/python</span> --config <span className="placeholder">myrules/myrule.yaml</span></code></pre>

## Appendix

We are working on optimizations to improve Semgrep's performance, which necessitates a change in rules processing. If you are using v0.55.0 or later and encounter an unexpected metavariable binding or missing result, try running with `--optimizations none` to use the original code path. 

You may find some files that Semgrep previously parsed are now skipped; this happens when Semgrep can confirm the rule does not match the file without parsing it. You can similarly run Semgrep with `--optimizations none` to avoid this behavior.

## Findings

* See [Managing findings](../managing-findings/) for information on Semgrep findings.
* See [Ignoring findings](../ignoring-files-folders-code/) for details on suppressing rule output.
