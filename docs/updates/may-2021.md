# May 2021

## Version 0.52.0

This version also includes release notes for Semgrep version 0.53.0.

### Additions

- Alpha support for C#
- Metavariables match both a constant variable occurrence and that same constant value ([#3058](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3058))

### Fixes

- OCaml: fix useless-else false positives by generating appropriate AST for if without an else.
- JavaScript/TypeScript: Propagate constant definitions without declaration

## Version 0.51.0

### Additions

- Keep track of and report rule parse time in addition to file parse time
- v0 of opt-in, anonymous aggregate metrics

### Fixes

- JavaScript/TypeScript: allow the deep expression operator `<... ...>` in expression statement position, for example:

```

ARG = [$V];

...

<... $O[$ARG] ...>; // this works now

```

- PHP arrays with dots inside parse
- Propagate constants in nested lvalues such as y in x[y]
- Experimental support for C#

### Changes

- Show log messages from semgrep-core when running semgrep with --debug
- By default, targets larger than 1 MB are now excluded from Semgrep scans. The new option --max-target-bytes 0 restores the previous behavior.
- Report relative path instead of absolute when using --time

## Version 0.50.1

### Additions

- JS/TS: Infer global constants even if the const qualifier is missing ([#2978](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/2978))
- PHP: Resolve names and infer global constants in the same way as for Python

### Fixes

- Empty yaml files do not crash
- Autofix does not insert newline characters for patterns from semgrep.live ([#3045](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3045))
- Autofix printout is grouped with its own finding rather than the one below it ([#3046](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/3046))
- Do not assign constant values to assigned variables ([#2805](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/2805))
- A --time flag instead of --json-time which shows a summary of the timing information when invoked with normal output and adds a time field to the json output when --json is also present

### Changes

- Moved some debug logging to verbose logging
- $...ARGS can now match an empty list of arguments, just like ... ([#3177](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/3177))
- JSON and SARIF outputs sort keys for predictable results
- .git/ directories are ignored when scanning
- External Python API (semgrep_main.invoke_semgrep) now takes an optional OutputSettings argument for controlling output
- json_time has moved to OutputSettings.output_time, this and many other OutputSettings arguments have been made optional

### Removed

- `--json-time` flag in favor of `--json` + `--time`
