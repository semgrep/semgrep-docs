# Extensions

Several third-party tools include Semgrep extensions.


### Editor

### Pre-commit

The [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/) can run `semgrep` at commit-time. [Install `pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/#install) and add the following to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

```yaml
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep
  rev: 'SEMGREP_VERSION_LATEST'
  hooks:
    - id: semgrep
      # See semgrep.dev/rulesets to select a ruleset and copy its URL
      args: ['--config', '<SEMGREP_RULESET_URL>', '--error', '--skip-unknown-extensions']
```
