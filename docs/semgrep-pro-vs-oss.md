# Semgrep Pro versus Semgrep OSS

You can use Semgrep Pro or Semgrep OSS to scan your code for security issues, bugs, and compliance to coding standards. Semgrep uses both an engine and rules to scan your code.

**Rules**, which are written in YAML, describe how Semgrep generates a **finding**, such as a security issue. A rule encapsulates the pattern-matching logic and is meant to be readable and customizable.

Semgrep Pro includes different types of analyses, such as Semgrep Code's cross-file, cross-function analysis in Semgrep Code. Semgrep OSS runs only single-function analysis.

This document outlines key differences between the Semgrep OSS and Pro product lines.

The terms used in this document are defined as follows:

<dl>
  <dt>Semgrep OSS</dt>
  <dd>
    Refers to Semgrep offerings with an open source license, primarily the Semgrep OSS Engine, a fast and customizable static application security testing (SAST) scanner. To run Semgrep completely on OSS, use the OSS Engine and rules in the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/r/"><i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Semgrep Registry</a> with <strong>open source licenses</strong>, or write your own custom rules.
  </dd>
  <dt>Semgrep Pro</dt>
  <dd>
    Refers to proprietary product offerings from Semgrep, Inc. These include:
    <dl>
      <dt>Semgrep Code</dt><dd>A SAST scanner that uses cross-file (interfile) and cross-function (interprocedural) analysis for improved results over Semgrep OSS. Semgrep Code includes premium rules, known as Pro rules, that use the cross-file analysis to reduce false positives.</dd>
      <dt>Semgrep Supply Chain</dt><dd>A high-signal dependency scanner that detects reachable vulnerabilities in open source third-party libraries and functions across the software development life cycle (SDLC).</dd>
      <dt>Semgrep Secrets</dt><dd>A secrets scanner that, in addition to detecting secrets, validates these leaked secrets on a variety of services to help you prioritize active secrets.</dd>
      <dt>Semgrep AppSec Platform</dt><dd>A web application for the deployment, management, and monitoring of findings from Semgrep's SAST, SCA, and secrets scanners. It integrates with continuous integration (CI) providers such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, and more.</dd>

\*Private rules refer to rules that are guaranteed a private access scope in the cloud. This scope of access does not apply to Semgrep OSS, as Semgrep OSS is purely CLI-based.<br />
† Policy-based workflows provide security teams a means to block merges, leave PR/MR comments, or silently monitor for potential issues based on the presence of a finding.
