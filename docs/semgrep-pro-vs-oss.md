# Semgrep AppSec Platform versus Semgrep OSS

You can use Semgrep AppSec Platform or Semgrep OSS to scan your code for security issues, bugs, and compliance to coding standards. However, there are key differences between the two offerings.

## Semgrep OSS

**Semgrep OSS** is comprised of an open source, lightweight SAST scanner and rules in the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/r/"><i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Semgrep Registry</a> with <strong>open source licenses</strong>. You can also write your own custom rules for use with Semgrep OSS. By itself, it does not provide comprehensive finding triage or remediation. You can, however, output findings to various common formats, such as JSON and SARIF.

Semgrep OSS is best for small teams or personal projects.

### Deployment and CI integration 

Semgrep OSS primarily runs in your local machine's CLI. It can also scan a remote repository by running a CI job. However, you must write and configure the CI job for each repository. The results can then be passed to an AppSec Posture Management software, such as DefectDojo, or GitHub Advanced Security.

### Analysis

Semgrep OSS provides single-function, single-file analysis. This makes it fast, at the cost of coverage and precision. It can't trace data beyond a single function or file and may find more false positives.

### AppSec workflows, AI, notifications, and reports

You must manually set up workflows to import Semgrep OSS findings into other tools to perform common AppSec workflows, such as triage.

## Semgrep AppSec Platform

**Semgrep AppSec Platform** is a software suite tailored to support AppSec engineers through the entire software development life cycle (SDLC). It uses a proprietary engine that provides additional static analyses and improved semantic comprension.

### Products 

- Proprietary SAST, SCA, and secret scanners.
- Greater parsing support for all languages supported by Semgrep OSS.
  - Some languages are exclusive to Semgrep AppSec Platform.
- More types of static analyses, such as cross-function (interprocedural) and cross-file (interfile) taint analyses.
- Professionally maintained rules and rule maintenance for many languages.
- Support for scanning in a variety of environments and source code managers (SCMs) such as GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and Azure.
- PR or MR scans.
- Scan customization features.
- Scan results (findings) management

Features for AppSec workflows include:

- Deployment at scale.
- Secure guardrail deployment
- Findings management, including triage and remediation.
- User and repository (project) management
- AppSec triage and remediation workflows
- SBOM export, reporting, and license detection
- LLM (large language model) AI integration

## üß∞ Scan customization features

The following table displays customization features and tools that enhance Semgrep's core scanning capabilities. These features can increase true-positive rate and provide deeper insights into remediation.

| Feature                                                      | Semgrep OSS                                     | Semgrep Pro                            |

\*Private rules refer to rules that are guaranteed a private access scope in the cloud. This scope of access does not apply to Semgrep OSS, as Semgrep OSS is purely CLI-based.<br />
‚Ä† Policy-based workflows provide security teams a means to block merges, leave PR/MR comments, or silently monitor for potential issues based on the presence of a finding.

### ü§ñ Developer experience

The following table lists tools to enable developers to resolve findings in their own code.

| GPT-assisted autofix      | --          | ‚úîÔ∏è                 |

‚Ä°`pre-commit` requires some manual set-up.
