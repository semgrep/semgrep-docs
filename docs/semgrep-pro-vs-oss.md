# Semgrep AppSec Platform versus Semgrep OSS

You can use Semgrep AppSec Platform or Semgrep OSS to scan your code for security issues, bugs, and compliance to coding standards. However, there are key differences between the two offerings.

## Semgrep OSS

**Semgrep OSS** is comprised of an open source, lightweight SAST scanner and rules in the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/r/"><i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Semgrep Registry</a> with <strong>open source licenses</strong>. You can also write your own custom rules for use with Semgrep OSS. 

Semgrep OSS is best for small teams or personal projects.

### Deployment and CI integration 

Semgrep OSS primarily runs in your local machine's CLI through the `semgrep scan` command. It can also scan a remote repository by running a CI job. However, you must write and configure the CI job for each repository. 

<!-- Environments are omitted due to differences in licensing -
`semgrep scan` can be run in IDE atm but the extension is proprietary -->

### Scanning and analysis 

Semgrep OSS provides single-function, single-file analysis. This makes it fast, at the cost of coverage and precision. It can't trace data beyond a single function or file and may find more false positives.

### Triage and remediation

By itself, Semgrep does not provide comprehensive triage or remediation for your findings. You can, however, output findings to various common formats, such as JSON and SARIF, then send those findings to an AppSec Posture Management (ASPM) software such as DefectDojo or GitHub Advanced Security.

## Semgrep AppSec Platform

**Semgrep AppSec Platform** is a software suite tailored to support AppSec engineers through the entire software development life cycle (SDLC).

### Deployment and CI

Semgrep AppSec Platform can perform scans in the following environments:

- CI
- Web app (for Managed Scans)
- CLI
- IDE
- `pre-commit`

Your scan configuration, such as rules and policies, or type of scan (SAST, SCA, or secrets) are preserved across all environments.

Users comfortable with granting Semgrep code acces, can quickly deploy Semgrep to thousands of repositories through Managed Scans. tk link

GitHub users with admin privileges to their GitHub org can also quickly deploy Semgrep in their CI pipelines through the web app. The Semgrep web app can automatically detect repositories in your org and commit a GitHub workflow file to run Semgrep.

## üß∞ Scan customization features

The following table displays customization features and tools that enhance Semgrep's core scanning capabilities. These features can increase true-positive rate and provide deeper insights into remediation.

\*Private rules refer to rules that are guaranteed a private access scope in the cloud. This scope of access does not apply to Semgrep OSS, as Semgrep OSS is purely CLI-based.<br />
‚Ä† Policy-based workflows provide security teams a means to block merges, leave PR/MR comments, or silently monitor for potential issues based on the presence of a finding.

### ü§ñ Developer experience

The following table lists tools to enable developers to resolve findings in their own code.
