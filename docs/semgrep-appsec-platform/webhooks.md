# Enable webhooks

Webhooks are a generic method for Semgrep AppSec Platform to post JSON-formatted findings after each scan to your URL endpoint.

Semgrep sends two types of JSON objects:

<dl>
<dt><code>semgrep_scan</code> JSON object</dt>
<dd> A <code>semgrep_scan</code> object contains information about the CI job and other scan parameters, such as ignored files. Semgrep sends a single <code>semgrep_scan</code> object <strong>every time a scan is run</strong>. This includes diff-aware scans, full scans, and scans that have no findings.</dd>
<dt><code>semgrep_finding</code> JSON object</dt>
<dd>A <code>semgrep_finding</code> object is a single record of a new finding. Semgrep sends new <code>semgrep_finding</code> objects based on how you have configured your notifications in Policies. See <a href="#setting-up-webhooks">Setting up webhooks</a> to learn more.</dd>
</dl>

## Set up webhooks

Perform these steps in Semgrep AppSec Platform to set up webhooks:

1. Create a webhook integration:
    1. On the navigation menu, click **<i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> Settings > Integrations > Add Integration.**
    2. Click **Webhook**.
    3. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the integration.
    4. In the **Webhook URL** field, enter the target webhook URL for the integration.
    5. Optional: To ensure that Semgrep can post to your URL, click **Test**. The following screenshot displays the result of a successful webhook integration.
    ![Successful webhook integration test](/img/webhook-successful-test.png)
    6. Click **Save.**
2. Turn notifications on:
    1. Click **Rules > Policies > <i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> Rule Modes**.
    2. Click the **Edit** button of the Rule Mode for which you want to receive webhook notifications. For example, if you want to be notified of all blocking findings through webhooks, click the **Edit** button of the **Block** mode.
    3. Repeat the previous step for all Rule Modes that you want to receive notifications for.
