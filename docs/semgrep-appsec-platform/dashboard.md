# Evaluating your security posture through the Dashboard

![Screenshot of dashboard view](/img/dashboard-view.png)

The Semgrep AppSec Platform Dashboard is an overview of your organization’s security posture from data aggregated within the Semgrep AppSec Platform. With these metrics you can:

* View recurring security issues, consequently taking action on them.
* Improve communication between developer teams and security teams.
* Detect vulnerabilities early, thereby preventing these from persisting through to the next stage of product delivery, such as QA.

You can access the Dashboard by [logging into the Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login?return_path=/manage/projects).

## Assessing security readiness at a glance

![Screenshot of dashboard Code widget](/img/dashboard-code.png)

The **Code** widget displays high-level security analytics across your entire organization. This includes:
<dl>
	<dt>High severity</dt>
	<dd>Findings generated by a rule with the severity value set to <code>ERROR</code>. These include security backdoors and highly vulnerable code. If you filter for another time period than <b>All time</b> the displayed number badge compares the number of high-severity findings within the given time period against the previous time period.</dd>
	<dt>Open findings</dt>
	<dd>The number of open findings over the <b>given time period</b>. The badge number indicates whether this number has gone up or down compared to the previous timeframe. If you filter for another time period than <b>All time</b> the displayed number badge compares the most recent number of open findings against the previous timeframe.</dd>
	<dt>Comment fix rate</dt>
	<dd>The percentage of findings that were fixed when findings surfaced to developers through PR or MR comments in previous scans. If you filter for another time period than <b>All time</b> the displayed number badge compares PR and MR fix rate in the given time period against the previous time period.</dd>
</dl>

## Filtering findings by time

The Dashboard displays data from scans for the **All time** by default. This time range can be set to a narrower value. By broadening the time range, security teams are able to see total numbers and statistics across an entire time period. Narrow time ranges can give insights into the most recent vulnerabilities creeping into the project.

To change the time range of scan data over time:

1. Click the <i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-days"></i> **Last 1 month** button.
2. Select a time range from the drop-down box. The Dashboard, including all widgets, reloads to reflect data from the selected time period.

## Filtering findings by projects

The Dashboard displays data from scans for **all of the organization's projects** by default. Select one or a few projects to filter the dashboard widgets to only reflect scans from selected projects. Selecting a few projects gives you a more targeted view of those projects' security posture.

To change the projects filter:

1. Click the <i class="fa-solid fa-sliders"></i> **All projects** button.
2. Select projects from the drop-down box. The Dashboard, including all widgets, reloads to reflect data from the selected projects.

## Summarizing the security posture of a project

![Screenshot of dashboard projects](/img/dashboard-most-findings.png)

The **Most findings** widget displays open findings, high severities, and fix rates per-project. Through this view, you can see a specific number of findings in given projects. The columns are arranged in descending order, from the project with the greatest amount of findings to the least.

To view the project’s findings, click the project’s name. This takes you to the [Findings page](/semgrep-code/findings), where you can filter, sort, and triage findings.

## Assessing rule performance

![Screenshot of dashboard rules widget](/img/dashboard-rules.png)

The **Rules summary** widget provides a summary report for rule metrics, such as what rules are ignored or fired the most.

These data points can serve as a starting point for the following security audits:

- Investigating the relevance or quality of a rule. For example: Is this rule useful, or does it detect too many false positives?
- Are there underlying issues in the codebase that result in recurring patterns of insecure code?
- Are there rules that developers don’t resolve? Semgrep helps identify such rules, which helps to form insights into possible causes.

## Using Dashboard with Semgrep Supply Chain

Semgrep Dashboard can display vulnerable dependency findings of Semgrep Supply Chain.

![Screenshot of dashboard with Semgrep Supply Chain](/img/dashboard-with-supply-chain.png)

Semgrep Supply Chain dashboard consists of three widgets:
<dl>
	<dt>Supply Chain</dt>
	<dd>Contains three items: <b>Reachable</b>, <b>Unreachable</b>, and <b>Undetermined</b> vulnerabilities.</dd>
	<dt>Most vulnerabilities</dt>
	<dd>The number of dependency vulnerabilities over the given time period next to the calendar icon.</dd>
	<dt>New advisories</dt>
	<dd>Announcements of new vulnerabilities.</dd>
</dl>

:::tip
Filters mentioned in previous sections [Filtering findings by time](#filtering-findings-by-time) and [Filtering findings by projects](#filtering-findings-by-projects) are also applied to Semgrep Supply Chain widgets.

Technical Writer NOTE: The following sections are no longer functional in Semgrep Dashboard. Section "Discovering trends in vulnerabilities through OWASP categories" can be reused as it offers a good description of many OWASP categories (maybe in Cheat sheets).

## Discovering trends in vulnerabilities through OWASP categories

![Screenshot of dashboard categories](/img/dashboard-categories.png)

Trends in insecure code can emerge after multiple Semgrep scans over time. By identifying these patterns, security teams are better informed about specific areas for improvement. Semgrep enables security teams to see the breakdown of vulnerabilities detected through the **Categories widget**, which includes:

<dl>
	<dt>Code injection</dt>
	<dd>Refers to poor handling of untrusted data (data from user inputs, integrations, and the like) that leads to malicious actors injecting their own code into the application. Semgrep Registry provides <a href="https://semgrep.dev/p/sql-injection">a ruleset guarding against SQL injection</a> for a variety of languages.</dd>
	<dt>Cookie flag</dt>
	<dd>Indicates issues with session management, specifically the misuse or underuse of cookie attributes such as <code>secure</code>, <code>HttpOnly</code>, <code>SameSite</code>, to prevent cookie theft and other cookie-related attacks. The Semgrep rule <a href="https://semgrep.dev/playground?registry=go.gorilla.security.audit.session-cookie-missing-httponly.session-cookie-missing-httponly">"Session Cookie Missing HttpOnly"</a> is an example written for Go language.</dd>
	<dt>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</dt>
	<dd>This category tracks patterns in code that may result in CSRF attacks. CSRF attacks occur when an attacker induces users to perform unintentional actions. These issues can be detected based on a codebase’s framework, such as Django. In the rule, <a href="https://semgrep.dev/playground?registry=python.django.security.audit.csrf-exempt.no-csrf-exempt">"No CSRF Exempt"</a>, Semgrep detects when a Django route does not have a CSRF token, the lack of which could lead to an attack.</dd>
	<dt>Active debug code</dt>
	<dd>A type of vulnerability stemming from debug code such as <code>alert</code> that may unintentionally telegraph sensitive application behavior or secrets. The Semgrep rule <a href="https://semgrep.dev/playground?registry=javascript.lang.best-practice.leftover_debugging.javascript-alert">"Leftover debugging"</a> is a JavaScript example.</dd>
	<dt>Cryptography</dt>
	<dd>Refers to the use of weak hashing algorithms and the like, such as the use of MD5 in tokens or secrets. This <a href="https://semgrep.dev/playground?registry=python.cryptography.security.insecure-cipher-algorithms.insecure-cipher-algorithm-blowfish">Blowfish detection rule for Python</a> provides a guardrail against easily decipherable ciphers.</dd>
	<dt>Deserialization</dt>
	<dd>Insecure deserialization occurs when an attacker is able to insert their own code, typically their own objects, as a website or app deserializes from flatter formats such as JSON. The rule <a href="https://semgrep.dev/playground?registry=python.flask.security.insecure-deserialization.insecure-deserialization">"Insecure deserialization"</a> for Flask detects the use of insecure libraries and advises the developer to use something more secure.</dd>
	<dt>Path traversal</dt>
	<dd>Path traversal occurs when malicious actors attempt to access files and directories outside of the web root folder. This is also known as directory traversal. In this <a href="https://semgrep.dev/playground?registry=java.jax-rs.security.jax-rs-path-traversal.jax-rs-path-traversal">Java example</a>, Semgrep detects potential path traversals through the insertion of <code>../</code>.</dd>
	<dt>Regex</dt>
	<dd>Various issues with regex patterns fall under this category. This includes overly permissive regex, custom regex patterns for common use-cases (which can be refactored as validated patterns from authorities such as OWASP), and <a href="https://semgrep.dev/playground?registry=javascript.lang.security.audit.detect-non-literal-regexp.detect-non-literal-regexp">patterns that may result in ReDoS</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Open redirect</dt>
	<dd>Open redirects happen when user input is incorporated into a redirection target. Malicious actors can then construct a lengthy URL pointing away from the expected domain, though it appears authentic in the beginning of the URL string. This exploit is used in phishing by sending a user an email with a link that appears genuine but steers them away from the trusted domain. In this <a href="https://semgrep.dev/playground?registry=python.flask.security.open-redirect.open-redirect">Flask example</a>, data directly from the request is passed to the redirect function, which could be exploited.</dd>
	<dt>Command injection</dt>
	<dd>Command injection occurs when an attacker uses some type of input to run <strong>system commands</strong> on the host operating system. This is also known as shell injection. In <a href="https://semgrep.dev/playground?registry=go.lang.security.audit.dangerous-syscall-exec.dangerous-syscall-exec">"Audit dangerous syscall"</a>, written for Go programming language, a finding is detected for non-static input to <code>syscall</code>, which if reached by user data, makes it vulnerable to exploitation.</dd>
</dl>

### Rule performance through Developer Feedback

![Screenshot of developer feedback](/img/dashboard-devfeedback.png)

In Team/Enterprise Dashboards, these additional metrics are visible:

* Most disliked
* Slowest

The **Most disliked** metric is taken from the **Developer Feedback** feature. Developers are able to provide feedback on findings that are not the most accurate. This feature is available for Team/Enterprise users.
