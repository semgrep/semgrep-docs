# Alerts and notifications

Receive notifications in various channels, such as Slack and email, through Semgrep AppSec Platform. This document guides you through setup procedures and Semgrep's deduplication behavior. This ensures that you receive high-signal notifications and alerts in your preferred channels.

Semgrep AppSec Platform can send notifications through the following channels:

| Tool                               | Tier availability |
| ----                               | ----------------  |
| [Slack](/semgrep-cloud-platform/slack-notifications)                             | Team & Enterprise  |
| [Email](/semgrep-cloud-platform/email-notifications)                             | Team & Enterprise  |
| [Webhooks](/semgrep-cloud-platform/webhooks)                           | Team & Enterprise   |

### Semgrep Autofix

[Autofix](/writing-rules/autofix) is a Semgrep feature in which rules contain suggested fixes to resolve findings. Either metavariables or regex matches are replaced with a potential fix. Due to their complexity, not all rules make use of autofix, but for rules that use this feature, autofix allows you to quickly resolve findings as part of your code review workflow. Semgrep Code can suggest these fixes through PR or MR comments within GitHub or GitLab, thus integrating seamlessly with your review environment.

Autofix is free to use for all tiers.

In the following screenshot, Semgrep detects the use of a native Python XML library, which is vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) attacks. The PR comment automatically suggests a fix by replacing `import xml` to `import defusedxml`.

#### Enabling autofix for GitHub or GitLab 

Autofix requires PR or MR comments to be enabled for your repository or organization. Follow the steps in [GitHub pull request comments](#github-pull-request-comments) or [GitLab merge request comments](#gitlab-merge-request-comments) to enable this feature.

<EnableAutofix />

All scans performed after enabling autofix generate inline PR or MR comments with code suggestions for applicable rules.

## Notification and alert de-duplication

Notifications are sent only the first time a given finding is detected.

Because of Semgrep CI's diff-awareness, you will not be notified
when a pull request has a finding that existed on the base branch already,
even if that line is moved or re-indented.

Semgrep AppSec Platform also keeps track of notifications that have already been sent,
so consecutive scans of the same changes in the same pull request
won't send duplicate notifications.
