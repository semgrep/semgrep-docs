# Alerts and notifications

You can receive notifications for Semgrep findings in the following channels:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Channel</th>
<th>Semgrep Code</th>
<th>Semgrep Supply Chain</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>[Slack](/semgrep-appsec-platform/slack-notifications)</td>
<td rowspan="3">Integrate with Semgrep through **Settings > Integrations**. Customize through rule modes in [Policies page](/semgrep-code/policies).</td>
<td>Integrate with Semgrep through **Settings > Integrations**. Limited customizability; configured by default to send notifications on <strong>reachable</strong> findings</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>[Email](/semgrep-appsec-platform/email-notifications)</td>
<td>Not available</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>[Webhooks](/semgrep-appsec-platform/webhooks)</td>
<td>Not available</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Setting up notifications involves the following steps:

1. Integrating the notification channel, such as Slack, with Semgrep.
2. Customizing the conditions under which a notification is sent to that channel. Available conditions and how they are set up varies depending on the Semgrep product; see the following table.

Semgrep Code **rule modes** define workflow actions (**Monitor**, **Comment**, or **Block**) that Semgrep Code performs when a rule detects a finding. In addition to these workflow actions, you can also configure Semgrep to send notifications on any rule mode.
