# Enable Bitbucket Data Center pull request comments

<DeploymentJourney />

Semgrep can create **pull request (PR) comments** in your Bitbucket repository. These comments provide a description of the issue detected by Semgrep and may offer possible solutions. They are a means for security teams, or any team responsible for creating standards to help their fellow developers write safe and standards-compliant code.

Automated comments on Bitbucket pull requests are displayed as follows:

## Enable PR comments in Bitbucket

### Prerequisites

In addition to finishing the previous steps in your deployment journey, it is recommended that you complete a **full scan** on your **default branch** for the repository in which you want to receive comments.
- You must have a Bitbucket Data Center HTTP access token. Ensure that the [token HTTP access token that you create](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/http-access-tokens-939515499.html) has been granted **Project write** permissions. You'll provide this token to your CI provider during the setup process.

### Confirm your Semgrep account's connection

Confirm that you have the correct connection and access:

1. In your Semgrep AppSec Platform account, click **Settings > Source code managers**.
2. Check that an entry for your Bitbucket project exists and is correct.

### Configure comments for Semgrep Code
