# Enable Azure pull request comments

<DeploymentJourney />

Semgrep can create **pull request (PR) comments** in your Azure DevOps repository. These comments provide a description of the issue detected by Semgrep and may offer possible solutions. These comments are a means for security teams, or any team responsible for creating standards, to help their fellow developers write safe and standards-compliant code.

Automated comments on Azure DevOps pull requests are displayed as follows:

## Steps to set up PR comments

### Prerequisites

Semgrep currently supports repositories hosted by Azure DevOps Cloud.

In addition to finishing the previous steps in your deployment journey, it is recommended to have completed a **full scan** on your **default branch** for the repository in which you want to receive comments.

### Confirm your Semgrep account's connection

PR comments are enabled by default for users who have connected their Azure DevOps organization (org) to Semgrep AppSec Platform. Confirm that you have the correct connection and access:

1. In your Semgrep AppSec Platform account, click **Settings > Source code managers**.
2. Check that an entry for your Azure DevOps org exists and is correct.
