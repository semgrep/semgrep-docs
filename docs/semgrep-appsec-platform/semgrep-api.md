# Semgrep API

Semgrep AppSec Platform provides an API that enables you to list deployments, gather findings created by Semgrep AppSec Platform, and list projects. The API documentation uses the OpenAPI format. The API requires a [Team or Enterprise tier account](https://semgrep.dev/pricing/), with the subsequent API token provisioned in your settings.

See the API documentation of **[Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/)** for full reference information.
