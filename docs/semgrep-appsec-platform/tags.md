# Tagging projects

Add tags for specific projects in the Semgrep AppSec Platform through the following methods:

* Set tags through the Semgrep AppSec Platform > Project page.
* Set tags using the Semgrep AppSec Platform API (for Team and Enterprise Tier users).
* Set tags in your repository's `.semgrepconfig.yml` file.

:::caution Setting tags
* Keep in mind, when setting tags via the `.semgrepconfig.yml` file or Semgrep AppSec Platform API, that these actions **supersede** any tags previously set.
* For example, if you set tags through the API and subsequently run a CI scan, then the previous tags set by the API will be overwritten by any tag definitions in the `.semgrepconfig.yml` file of the repository.
* For this reason, we recommend exclusively choosing either the API or `.semgrepconfig.yml` file to manage and set tags. **Do not use a mix of the two.**

## Set tags through Semgrep AppSec Platform and Semgrep AppSec Platform API

To manage tags through Semgrep AppSec Platform, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Semgrep AppSec Platform [Projects](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/projects) page.
2. Click on the project's <i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> **gear** icon to enter project configuration page, and then add or remove tags.

Refer to [Semgrep API documentation](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/#tag/Project/operation/semgrep_app.saas.handlers.tagging.openapi_add_tags_to_project) to use the API.

## Set tags in `.semgrepconfig.yml`

You can also add tags through a specific file added to your repository. To do so, follow the instructions below:

1. Create `.semgrepconfig.yml` file in the root directory of your repository.
2. Add tags to the `.semgrepconfig.yml` file. Example of tags added to `.semgrepconfig.yml` file:
    ```yaml
    tags:
        - favourite
        - awesomeproject
    ```

:::caution
Changes to tags made through the `.semgrepconfig.yml` file are also visible in the **Semgrep AppSec Platform > Projects** page, however, the inverse is **not** true (changes in Semgrep AppSec Platform > Projects page will be overwritten by `.semgrepconfig.yml`.)
