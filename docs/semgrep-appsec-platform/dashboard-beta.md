# Dashboard (beta)

The Semgrep dashboard (beta) is an overview of your organizationâ€™s security posture from data aggregated within Semgrep AppSec Platform. It helps you achieve the following goals:

- Evaluation of the success of your AppSec program, enabling you to know your current security risk.
  - This includes assessing the deployment of secure guardrails to your organization.
- Awareness of trends and opportunities that you can use to improve your security posture.
  - You are able to view **recurring security issues**, consequently taking action on them.

The dashboard provides the following features:

- Filters that enable you to track metrics over a period of time, per Semgrep product, and per project.
- Insights

:::note
This feature is in a **private beta**. To request access, contact your Technical Account Manager or your Account Executive and let them know you'd like to join the dashboard beta.
