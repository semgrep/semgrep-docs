# Enable source code manager code access

import PL from '@site/src/components/Placeholder';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Some Semgrep features require additional levels of code access. You can grant these permissions to Semgrep by assigning additional scopes to the access token that facilitates communication between Semgrep and the source code manager (SCM). The following table shows the minimum scope needed to enable the required code access level.

#### Required SCM code access scopes

| SCM | Read access scope | Write access scope |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Azure DevOps | `code:read` | `code:write` |
| Bitbucket Cloud | `repository:read`<br />`pullrequest:read` | `repository:write`<br />`pullrequest:write` |
| Bitbucket Data Center | `repository:read` | `repository:write` |
| GitHub.com and Github Enterprise | `contents:read` | `contents:write` |
| GitLab and Gitlab Self-Managed | `read_repository` | `write_repository` |

## Grant code access to Semgrep with a private GitHub app

If you already have a private Semgrep GitHub app set up and configured for your deployment that **doesn't** have code access enabled, follow these steps to update the app and grant code access to Semgrep.

If you don't know the name of your app slug, you can find it on the [**Settings > Source code managers** page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/source-code).

1. Navigate to the GitHub Application permissions and events page. GitHub Enterprise users must replace the `https://github.com` base URL with the base URL of the GitHub Enterprise instance.
    1. For organization accounts, go to <code>https://github.com/organizations/<PL>ORGANIZATION_NAME</PL>/settings/apps/<PL>APP_SLUG</PL>/permissions</code>.
    1. For user accounts, go to <code>https://github.com/settings/apps/<PL>APP_SLUG</PL>/permissions</code>
2. Expand **Repository Permissions**.
3. Under **Contents**, change the access level to **Read and write**.
4. Click **Save Changes**.
5. At this point, GitHub sends you or your GitHub admin an email to approve the permissions changes. Once approved, Semgrep has code access to your GitHub instance.
