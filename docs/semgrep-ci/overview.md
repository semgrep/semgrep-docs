# Semgrep CI

[Semgrep CI](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-action) (aka Semgrep Action or `semgrep-agent`) is a specialized Docker image for running Semgrep in CI environments. It can also optionally connect to [Semgrep App](https://semgrep.dev/manage) for centralized rule and findings management.

- **Scan every commit**. Semgrep CI rapidly scans modified files on pull and merge requests, protecting developer productivity. Longer full project scans are configurable on merges to specific branches.
- **Block new bugs**. You shouldn’t have to fix existing bugs just to adopt a tool. Semgrep CI reports newly introduced issues on pull and merge requests, scanning them at their base and HEAD commits to compare findings. Developers are signficantly more likely to fix the issues they introduced themselves on PRs and MRs.
- **Get findings where you work**. Semgrep CI can connect to [Semgrep App](https://semgrep.dev/manage) to present findings in Slack, on PRs and MRs via inline comments, email, and through 3rd party services.

:::info
Semgrep CI runs fully in your build environment: **your code is never sent anywhere**.
:::


## Getting started

Semgrep CI behaves like other static analysis and linting tools: it runs a set of user-configured rules and returns a non-zero exit code if there are findings, resulting in its job showing a ✅ or ❌.

Start by copying the below relevant template for your CI provider. Read through the comments in the template to adjust when and what Semgrep CI scans, selecting pull and merge requests, merges to branches, or both.

Once Semgrep CI is running, explore the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) to find and add more project-specific rules.

See [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration) for further customizations, such as ignoring files and tuning performance.

### GitHub Actions

:::info
You can add Semgrep CI automatically to a GitHub repository by clicking "Set up" on the [Projects page](https://semgrep.dev/manage/projects) of Semgrep App. You'll be able to adjust pull request and  merge behavior before Semgrep App asks to commit a workflow file to your repository.
:::

To manually add Semgrep CI to GitHub Actions, add a `.github/workflows/semgrep.yml` file to your repository. Follow the [workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

See this [example GitHub Actions workflow configuration](../sample-ci-configs/#github-actions) for Semgrep CI.

### GitLab CI/CD

:::info
Automatic setup is coming to GitLab CI/CD soon, where Semgrep App can commit Semgrep CI configurations to your projects. [Sign up for the beta here](https://go.r2c.dev/join-gitlab-beta)!
:::

To add Semgrep CI to GitLab CI/CD, add a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to your repository if not already present. Add a block to run the Semgrep CI job in your pipeline, following [GitLab’s configuration guide for the .gitlab-ci.yml file](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/gitlab_ci_yaml.html).

See this [example GitLab CI/CD configuration](../sample-ci-configs/#gitlab-ci) for Semgrep CI.

If you’re already running [GitLab SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/) by including `template: Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml` in your CI/CD configuration, you can still include and customize Semgrep CI. GitLab SAST, including its `semgrep-sast` analyzer, will continue to run normally.

### Other CI providers

To add Semgrep CI to any CI environment, use the [`returntocorp/semgrep-agent:v1`](https://hub.docker.com/r/returntocorp/semgrep-agent) Docker image directly:

For full project scans:

```sh
docker run -v $(pwd):/src --workdir /src returntocorp/semgrep-agent:v1 semgrep-agent --config auto --config <other rule or rulesets>
```

Set the `--baseline-ref` flag to the git ref (branch name, tag, or commit hash) to use as a baseline. Semgrep will scan only the files modified in your branch and output the difference in findings between the baseline branch and the new branch. For example, to report findings newly added since branching off from your `main` branch, run

```sh
semgrep-agent --baseline-ref main
```

To connect your Semgrep CI scans to Semgrep App, you can optionally provide the following environment variables:

<details><summary>Environment Variables</summary>
<br />

## Set additional environment variables

```sh
SEMGREP_BRANCH=mybranch
SEMGREP_COMMIT=abcd1234  # commit SHA being scanned
SEMGREP_JOB_URL=https://example.com/me/myjob  # URL to CI logs
SEMGREP_REPO_NAME=myorg/myrepository  # project name to show on Semgrep App
SEMGREP_REPO_URL=https://gitwebsite.com/myrepository
SEMGREP_PR_ID=123
SEMGREP_PR_TITLE="Added four new bugs"  # shown in Slack notifications if set
SEMGREP_TIMEOUT=1800  # Maximum Semgrep run time in seconds, or 0 to disable timeouts
```

</details>

## Run semgrep_agent

```sh
semgrep-agent --publish-token $SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN
```

<br />

These instructions have been used on the following providers by the community:


| CI Providers         |                       |  
|:---------- |:---------------------------|
| Bitbucket Pipelines | Codeship |
| Bitrise | GitHub Actions [(sample configuration)](../sample-ci-configs/#github-actions) |

# Reviewing Findings

## Scan output

Semgrep CI exits with exit code 1 if the scan returned any findings.
This will cause your CI provider to show a ❌ next to the job.
You can find a description of the findings in the log output.

<details>
<summary>Click for an example of Semgrep CI's job output</summary>

```sh
=== looking for current issues in 1 file
| 1 current issue found
=== looking for pre-existing issues in 1 file
| No pre-existing issues found

python.flask.security.injection.os-system-injection.os-system-injection
     > flask_todomvc/todos.py:30
     ╷
   30│   os.system(id)
     ╵
     = User data detected in os.system. This could be vulnerable to a command
       injection and should be avoided. If this must be done, use the
       'subprocess' module instead and pass the arguments as a list.

=== exiting with failing status
```

</details>
<br />

:::note
Rules are 'blocking' by default and behave as described above.
When connected to Semgrep App, you can also add non-blocking rules to your scans.
Non-blocking rules return [non-blocking findings](#getting-notifications-instead-of-blocking-builds) which notify you via an integration but do not show up in log output, and do not cause jobs to fail with a ❌.
:::

### Integrations

Semgrep CI comes with many integrations with other services, to get you results in the workflow you're already used to, whether you're a developer or part of a security team.

#### Notifications

![Screenshot of a Slack notification describing the details of a finding](../img/slack-notification.png)<br />
A Slack notification triggered by new findings in a pull request

Notifications require connection to Semgrep App. You can get notified about new findings via:

- [GitHub pull request comments](/semgrep-app/notifications/#github-pull-request-comments)
- GitLab merge request comments ([sign up for the beta here](https://go.r2c.dev/join-gitlab-beta))
- [Slack messages](/semgrep-app/notifications/#slack)
- [emails](/semgrep-app/notifications/#email)
- [webhooks](/semgrep-app/notifications/#webhooks) (paid feature in Semgrep App)

To set up notifications:

1. Follow the links above to create a notification channel.
2. [Add the created channel to one or more policies](/semgrep-app/managing-policy/#changing-policy-actions)
as a policy action. Only the rules in these policies will trigger notifications.

:::note
Notifications are sent only the first time a given finding is seen. [See how notifications are de-duplicated](/semgrep-app/notifications/#de-duplication)
:::

#### Security Dashboards

![Screenshot of Semgrep App's findings dashboard showing a bar chart of findings over time, and a list of the most recent findings](../img/semgrep-app-overview.png)<br />
Semgrep App's findings overview page

A security dashboard gives you an overview of all your findings organization-wide.
You can review Semgrep CI's findings via:

- [GitLab SAST Security Dashboard](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/) (requires GitLab Ultimate subscription)
- [GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) (requires GitHub Enterprise subscription)
- [Semgrep App](https://semgrep.dev/manage) (free and paid tiers available)

## Advanced Configuration

### Registry rules and rulesets

:::info
These instructions apply to using Semgrep CI directly in your CI environment. For use with Semgrep App please use the "Add to policy" button next to any registry rule or ruleset, or visit [Dashboard > Policies](https://semgrep.dev/manage/policies).
:::

Semgrep CI accepts a list of rules and rulesets to run on each scan. To add from the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore), just include the rule or ruleset identifier in your CI workflow file. Identifiers take the form `p/<ruleset-id>` and `r/<rule-id>`. These identifiers can be copied directly for any rule or ruleset directly from the Registry, and run locally using the `--config <identifier>` flag with the [Semgrep command line tool](/getting-started/#run-semgrep-locally).

For example, in GitLab CI/CD:

```yaml
# ...
 variables:
    SEMGREP_RULES: >-
      p/security-audit
      p/secrets
# ...
```

Key names and configuration format for specific CI providers are available in the [sample CI configurations](../sample-ci-configs/).

### Custom rules

:::info
See [Writing rules](/writing-rules/overview/) to learn how to write custom rules.
:::

Your own custom rules can be added to your Semgrep CI configuration just like [Registry rules](#registry-rules-and-rulesets/) by:

1. Including their [Playground](https://semgrep.dev/editor) share ID (e.g. `s/susan:named-rule`)
2. Adding the directory or file path to the local file containing the rule
3. Adding the rule to a `.semgrep/` directory, which is included by default

For example, in GitLab CI/CD:

```yaml
# ...
 variables:
    SEMGREP_RULES: >-
      s/dlukeomalley:translation-of-non-string  # Playground share ID
      no-exec.yml                               # File containing one or more rules
      .semgrep/                                 # Directory containing rule yaml files 
# ...
```

If no configuration is provided and no `.semgrep.yml` or `.semgrep/` directory exists, Semgrep CI will exit with a non-zero error code.

### Ignoring files

Semgrep CI supports a `.semgrepignore` file that follows the `.gitignore` syntax and is used to skip files and directories during scanning. This is commonly used to avoid vendored and test related code. For a complete example, see the [.semgrepignore file on Semgrep’s source code](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/blob/develop/.semgrepignore).

:::caution
`.semgrepignore` is only used by Semgrep CI and is not honored by the Semgrep command line tool or by integrations like [GitLab's Semgrep SAST Analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep).
:::

By default Semgrep CI skips files and directories such as `tests/`, `node_modules/`, and `vendor/`. The full list of ignored items is in [the `.semgrepignore` template file](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-action/blob/v1/src/semgrep_agent/templates/.semgrepignore), which is used by Semgrep CI when no explicit `.semgrepignore` file is found in the root of your project.

For information on ignoring individual findings in code, see the [ignoring findings page](/ignoring-findings/).

### Audit scans

Semgrep CI has an audit mode that can be enabled to suppress non-zero exit codes when findings are found during branch scans. These scans are not differential in nature and by default pre-existing findings will fail the build. With audit mode enabled, even though findings will not cause non-zero exit codes, internal Semgrep errors and exception will still fail the build.

This behavior is beneficial for those who want to ensure every merge to a branch is fully scanned but who don't want to interfere with the development process becuase of pre-existing issues. In this mode, [security dashboards](#security-dashboards) can still be kept up to date and [notifications](#notifications) can be received.

In GitHub Actions, the most common event names are `push` and `pull_request`. To enable audit mode on branch pushes in GitHub Actions, set the option `auditOn: push` in your workflow file.

In providers other than GitHub Actions and GitLab CI, Semgrep CI doesn't infer an event name from the environment. Therefore, all scan run on an event named `unknown`.

### Exit codes

| Exit code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **0** | Scan completed successfully and found no blocking findings |
| **1** | Scan completed successfully and found blocking findings |
| **2** | Scan failed and printed the error's details |

[Non-blocking findings](#getting-notifications-instead-of-blocking-builds) do not affect the exit code.

### Semgrep App connection

To use your Semgrep App account, set `--publish-token`. This acts as your username and password for authentication. You can generate an API token on the [Dashboard > Settings](https://semgrep.dev/manage/settings) page.

#### Ignoring specific rules in a ruleset or policy

You can customize the ruleset you're using to ignore some of its rules by [editing the Semgrep App policy](/semgrep-app/managing-policy/#editing-a-policy) used for your scans.

#### Getting notifications instead of blocking builds

Some rules point out hotspots that require careful review but are not certain to be insecure code. You might want to disable blocking when scanning with such rules, and instead use a [CI integration](/semgrep-app/notifications/) to get notifications.

You can set this up by [changing the actions of the Semgrep App policy](/semgrep-app/managing-policy/#changing-policy-actions) used for your scans.

<!-- # Technical details

## Behavior

Semgrep CI uses environment variables
to detect what context it's running in.
When it's running on a GitHub pull request or GitLab merge request,
diff-aware mode is automatically enabled,
with the branch-off point considered the baseline.
When using other providers, you need to set environment variables
that tell Semgrep CI what it should use as the baseline commit.
Many of our [sample CI configs for various providers](sample-ci-configs.md)
set these environment variables.

In diff-aware scans,
Semgrep CI determines which findings are new
by [finding all modified files](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-action/blob/develop/src/semgrep_agent/targets.py),
and running two scans on them behind the scenes.
First, it scans the current commit.
Then, it checks out the baseline commit
and scans the files that have findings currently.
Any findings that already existed in the baseline version are ignored.
Two [findings are considered identical](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-action/blob/develop/src/semgrep_agent/findings.py)
if the have the same rule ID, file path, matched source code, and count within the file.
The matched source code content is compared with whitespace trimmed,
so that re-indenting code doesn't create new findings.
This means that you will get notified about new findings when
a rule's ID changes, when a file is renamed, and when the code matched by a finding changes. -->
