# CI configuration reference

Configure Semgrep CI by passing these environment variables in your CI job.

:::info
While environment variables are the preferred way to configure Semgrep CI, pass any of these options as command-line options. Refer to the output of `semgrep ci --help` to find the corresponding flags.
:::

## Select rules to scan with (`SEMGREP_RULES`)

```sh
SEMGREP_RULES="p/security-audit p/secrets"
```

## Diff-aware scanning (`SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF`)

For [diff-aware scans](overview.md#features), this option filters scan results to those introduced after the git commit, in a branch, or tag. For example, you have a repository with 10 commits. You set the commit number 8 as the baseline. Consequently, Semgrep only returns scan results introduced by changes in commits 9 and 10.

:::note
It is recommended to perform baseline scans on other branches than your `main` branch. The Semgrep App keeps track of which findings have been fixed on a given branch. If you configure baseline scans on your main branch, and compare the last commit to the penultimate commit, Semgrep wrongly considers all findings as fixed. In this case, Semgrep only reports findings that appear in the last commit.
:::
 
### Examples of `SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF`

To only report findings newly added
since branching off from your `main` branch, set the following:
<pre class="language-bash"><code>SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF=<span className="placeholder">TOPIC-BRANCH-NAME</span></code></pre>

To only report findings newly added
after a specific commit, set the following:
<pre class="language-bash"><code>SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF=<span className="placeholder">INSERT_GIT_COMMIT_HASH</span></code></pre>

## Semgrep App token

You can configure which rules to run also with Semgrep App.
Get your token from [Semgrep App > Settings](https://semgrep.dev/manage/settings).

<pre class="language-bash"><code>SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=<span className="placeholder">TOKEN_VALUE</span></code></pre>

## Get hyperlinks in Semgrep App

Set these variables to hyperlink to the correct repositories, files, and PRs
in the Semgrep App UI & notifications.

```sh
SEMGREP_REPO_URL="https://github.com/foo/bar"
SEMGREP_BRANCH="feature/add-new-bugs"
SEMGREP_JOB_URL="https://ci-server.com/jobs/1234"
SEMGREP_REPO_NAME="foo/bar"
SEMGREP_COMMIT="a52bc1ef"
SEMGREP_PR_ID="44"
```

## Collect findings silently (`SEMGREP_AUDIT_ON`)

Set this to never fail the build due to findings when scanning.
Instead, just collect findings for [Semgrep App > Findings](https://semgrep.dev/manage/findings).

```
SEMGREP_AUDIT_ON="unknown"
```

## Configure a job timeout (`SEMGREP_TIMEOUT`)

To change the job timeout from the default of 1800 seconds. Set to 0 to disable job timeout.

```sh
SEMGREP_TIMEOUT="300"
```
