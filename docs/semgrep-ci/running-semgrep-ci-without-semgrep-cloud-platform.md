# Running Semgrep in continuous integration (CI) without Semgrep Cloud Platform

Run Semgrep in your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to scan your repository for code vulnerabilities and other issues. This guide explains how to set up Semgrep in your pipeline without the use of Semgrep Cloud Platform, also known as a **stand-alone** setup.

There are three general steps to setting up Semgrep in your CI pipeline:

1. Set up the CI job or action to scan with Semgrep and receive an exit code.
2. Test that the Semgrep job is scanning your repository and that you are able to view scan results in your CI provider's log.
3. Configure the CI job's parameters. It is easier to troubleshoot any parameters after testing that the job runs successfully.

![Steps to run Semgrep in CI without Semgrep Cloud Platform](/img/semgrep-ci-overview-noapp.png "Steps to integrate Semgrep in CI without Semgrep Cloud Platform")
*Figure 1. Steps to run Semgrep in CI without Semgrep Cloud Platform.*

This guide defines a job or CI job as a script executed within a certain environment and managed by a CI provider.

## Reasons for configuring additional CI job parameters


## Limitations of Semgrep stand-alone CI scans 

Running Semgrep in CI without Semgrep Cloud Platform bears specific limitations compared to the use of Semgrep in CI with Semgrep Cloud Platform. See the following list:

* Stand-alone CI jobs cannot send [PR comments]((/semgrep-cloud-platform/github-pr-comments) or [MR comments](/semgrep-cloud-platform/gitlab-mr-comments). These comments describe the finding and help developers resolve vulnerabilities and other code issues.
* Stand-alone CI jobs cannot block a pull or merge request based on a finding. There are no user-defined rule modes to distinguish between rules. Alternatively, Semgrep Cloud Platform's [Policies page](/semgrep-code/policies) lets users define certain actions, such as blocking PRs or MRs on a finding generated by a reliable rule.
* Findings are dumped to a log, so there is no record of a finding's **status**, such as open, ignored, or fixed.

## Setting up the CI job

`semgrep ci` is the command used to run Semgrep in a CI environment. In most cases, this is the recommended command to run in the CI job. This command is a subset of the `semgrep scan` command. `semgrep ci` command has the following characteristics:
 
* `semgrep ci` is git-aware. This means it is able to detect branches and git states. 
* `semgrep ci` makes use of environment variables to configure its behavior. 
* `semgrep ci` performs a full scan by default. This is the recommended behavior. Semgrep can be configured to perform a diff-aware scan.
* `semgrep ci` can be run on a local `.git` repository at any time to test its behavior before running it within a CI environment.

### Running Semgrep with template or sample CI configuration files

To integrate any CI provider in the following list, follow the instructions in [Sample CI configuration](/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs).

* [GitHub Actions](/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#github-actions)
* [GitLab CI/CD](/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#gitlab-cicd)
* [Jenkins](/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#jenkins)
* [Bitbucket Pipelines](/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#bitbucket-pipelines)
* [Buildkite](/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#buildkite)
* [CircleCI](/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#circleci)
* [Azure Pipelines](/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#azure-pipelines)

### Running Semgrep through other CI providers

Use either of the following methods to run Semgrep through other CI providers.

#### Direct docker usage 

Reference or add the [returntocorp/semgrep](https://hub.docker.com/r/returntocorp/semgrep) Docker image directly. The method to add the Docker image varies based on the CI provider. This method is used in the [BitBucket Pipelines code snippet](#bitbucket-pipelines-code-snippet).

#### Install `semgrep` within your CI job

If you cannot use the Semgrep Docker image, install Semgrep as a step or command within your CI job:

1. Add `pip3 install semgrep` into the configuration file as a step or command, depending on your CI provider's syntax.
2. Run any valid `semgrep ci` command, such as `semgrep ci --config auto`.

This method is used in the [Jenkins CI code snippet](#jenkins-ci-code-snippet).

## Configuring the CI job

The following sections describe methods to customize your CI job.

### Passing or failing the CI job

By default, a Semgrep CI job exits with exit code 1 if the scan returns any findings. This causes the job to fail.

Semgrep provides **fail open** options. These options enable you to suppress findings that block your pipeline:

<dl>
	<dt><code>semgrep ci</code></dt>
	<dd><strong>Fail</strong> on blocking findings, but <strong>passes</strong> on internal errors. This is the default behavior.</dd>
	<dt><code>semgrep ci --no-suppress-errors</code></dt>
	<dd>The Semgrep CI job <strong>fails</strong> on blocking findings and on internal errors.</dd>
	<dt><code>semgrep ci || true</code></dt>
	<dd><strong>Pass</strong> on blocking findings and on internal errors.</dd>
</dl>

Refer to [Semgrep exit codes](/docs/cli-reference/#exit-codes) to understand various internal issues that cause Semgrep to fail.

### Diff-aware scanning

<DiffAwareScanning />

### Setting a scan schedule

<CiScheduling />

### Customizing rules and rulesets

#### Adding rules to scan with `semgrep ci`

`semgrep ci` accepts a list of rules and rulesets to run on each scan. The rules and rulesets can come from the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore/), or your own rules. The sources for rules to scan with are:

* A `.semgrep` folder located at the root of your repository.
* The value of the `SEMGREP_RULES` environment variable.

The `SEMGREP_RULES` environment variable accepts a list of local and remote rules and rulesets to run. The `SEMGREP_RULES` list is delimited by a space (` `) if the variable is exported from a shell command or script block. For example, see the following BitBucket Pipeline snippet:

```yaml
# ...
  script:
    - export SEMGREP_RULES="p/nginx p/ci no-exec.yml" 
    - semgrep ci
# ...
```

The line defining `SEMGREP_RULES` defines three different sources, delimited by a space:

```
- export SEMGREP_RULES="p/nginx p/ci no-exec.yml" 
```

The example references two rulesets from Semgrep Registry (`p/nginx` and `p/ci`) and a rule available in the repository (`no-exec.yml`).

If the `SEMGREP_RULES` environment variable is defined from a YAML block, the list of rules and rulesets to run is delimited by a newline. See the following example of a GitLab CI/CD snippet:
```YAML
# ...
variables:
  SEMGREP_RULES: >-
    p/nginx
    p/ci
    no-exec.yml
# ...
```

#### Writing your own rules

Write custom rules to enforce your team's coding standards and security practices. Rules can be forked from existing community-written rules.

See [Writing rules](/writing-rules/overview/) to learn how to write custom rules.

### Ignoring files

<CiIgnoringFiles />

### Saving or exporting findings to a file

To save or export findings, pass file format options and send the formatted findings to a file.

For example, to save to a JSON file:

`semgrep ci --json > findings.json`

You can also use the SARIF format:

`semgrep ci --sarif > findings.sarif`

Refer to the [CLI reference](/cli-reference) for output formats.

## Migrating to Semgrep Cloud Platform from a stand-alone CI setup

Migrate to Semgrep Cloud Platform to:

* **View and manage findings in a centralized location**. False positives can be ignored through triage actions.These actions can be undertaken in bulk.
* **Configure rules and actions to undertake when a finding is generated by the rule**. You can undertake the following actions:
    * Audit the rule. This means that findings are kept within Semgrep's Findings page and are not surfaced to your team's SCM.
    * Show the finding to your team through the use of PR and MR comments.
    * Block the pull or merge request.

To migrate to Semgrep Cloud Platform:

1. Create an account in [Semgrep Cloud Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Click **[Projects](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/projects)** > **Scan New Project** > Run scan in CI.
3. Follow the steps in the setup to complete your migration.
4. Optional: If you have previously set a custom `SEMGREP_TIMEOUT` environment variable, commit it to the CI configuration file created by Semgrep Cloud Platform. Do not copy `SEMGREP_RULES`.
4. Optional: Remove the old CI job that does not use Semgrep Cloud Platform.
