<!-- Titles for tabs are based on the most recognizable product name; they don't have to be parallel -->

## GitHub Actions

To add a Semgrep configuration file in your GitHub Actions pipeline:

1. Create a `semgrep.yml` file in `.github/workflows` in the repository you want to scan.
2. Copy the relevant code snippet provided in [Sample GitHub Actions configuration file](#sample-github-actions-configuration-file).
3. Paste the relevant code snippet to `semgrep.yml` file. This is your Semgrep configuration file for GitHub Actions.
4. Commit the configuration file under <code><span className="placeholder">/REPOSITORY-ROOT-DIRECTORY/.github/workflows/semgrep.yml</span></code>.
5. The Semgrep job starts automatically upon detecting the committed `semgrep.yml` file.

:::note
If you are self-hosting your repository, you must [use a self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/choosing-the-runner-for-a-job#choosing-self-hosted-runners).
:::

### Sample GitHub Actions configuration file

<Tabs
    defaultValue="gha-semgrep"
    values={[
    {label: 'Default', value: 'gha-semgrep'},
    {label: 'Semgrep OSS', value: 'gha-oss'},
    ]}
>

<TabItem value='gha-semgrep'>

The following configuration creates a CI job that runs scans depending on what products you have enabled in Semgrep Cloud Platform.

<GhaSemgrepAppSast />

You can **run specific product scans** by passing an argument, such as `--supply-chain`. View the [list of arguments](/getting-started/cli/#scan-using-specific-semgrep-products).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='gha-oss'>

The following configuration creates a CI job that runs Semgrep OSS scans using rules configured for your programming language.

<GhaSemgrepOssSast />

You can customize the scan by entering custom rules or other rulesets to scan with. See [Scan your codebase with a specific ruleset](/getting-started/cli-oss/#scan-your-codebase-with-a-specific-ruleset).

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::caution
If you define both `branches` or `branches-ignore` *and* `paths` or `paths-ignore`, the workflow only runs when both filters are satisfied.

For example, if your configuration file includes the following definition, the workflow runs only if there are changes on the `development` branch to `.github/workflows/semgrep.yml` :

```yaml
push:
  branches:
    - development
  paths:
    - .github/workflows/semgrep.yml
```

## Azure Pipelines

:::info
Scanning a project with the `semgrep ci` command requires the project to be version-controlled by Git. If you have Azure Repos that are version-controlled with [Team Foundations Version Control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/what-is-tfvc?view=azure-devops), they must be migrated to Git to be scanned with `semgrep ci` and have results reported to the Semgrep Cloud Platform.
:::

To add Semgrep into Azure Pipelines:

1. Access the YAML pipeline editor within Azure Pipelines by following the [YAML pipeline editor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/yaml-pipeline-editor?view=azure-devops#edit-a-yaml-pipeline) guide.
2. Copy the relevant code snippet provided in [Sample Azure Pipelines configuration snippet](#sample-azure-pipelines-configuration-snippet) into the Azure Pipelines YAML editor.
3. Save the code snippet.
4. Set [environment variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch#secret-variables).
5. Group the environment variables as a [variable group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops&tabs=classic).
6. Optional: Create a separate CI job for diff-aware scanning, which scans only changed files in PRs or MRs, by repeating steps 1-4 and adding `SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF` as an environment variable.

### Sample Azure Pipelines configuration snippet

<Tabs
    defaultValue="azure-semgrep"
