# Sample continuous integration (CI) configurations

This document provides sample configuration snippets to run Semgrep CI on various continuous integration (CI) providers.

## Feature support

Support for certain features of Semgrep App depend on your CI provider or source code management tool (SCM). The following table breaks down the features and their availability:

| Feature | GitHub | GitLab | BitBucket | CI Provider support |
| ------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| **Diff-aware scanning** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Available (may need additional set up) | 
| **Hyperlinks** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes  |  ✅ Available (may need additional set up) |
| **SCM security dashboard** |  ✅ GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard |  ✅ GitLab SAST Dashboard | ❌ No | ❗ Only GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD |
| **PR or MR comments in Semgrep App** |  ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ CI provider agnostic; feature support is dependent on SCM |

*Table 1.* List of features and supported SCMs and CI providers.

<dl>
    <dt>Diff-aware scanning</dt>
    <dd>Semgrep can scan changes in files when running on a pull or merge request (PR or MR). This keeps the scan fast and reduces finding duplication.</dd>
    <dt>Receiving results (findings) as PR or MR comments</dt>
    <dd>This feature enables you to receive <a href="/docs/semgrep-app/notifications/#enabling-github-pull-request-comments">PR or MR comments</a> from Semgrep App on the lines of code that generated a finding.</dd>
    <dt>Hyperlinks to code</dt>
    <dd>Semgrep App collects findings in a Findings page. In this page, you can click on a finding to view the lines of code in your repository that generated the finding.</dd>
    <dt>SCM security dashboard</dt>
    <dd>Send Semgrep findings to your SCM's security dashboard.</dd>
</dl>

## GitHub Actions

To add a Semgrep configuration file in your GitHub Actions pipeline:

1. Create a `semgrep.yml` file within `.github/workflows` in the repository you want to scan.
2. Copy the relevant code snippet provided in [Sample GitHub Actions configuration file](#sample-github-actions-configuration-file).
3. Commit the configuration file.
4. The Semgrep job starts automatically upon detecting the committed `semgrep.yml` file. You can also start the job from the GitHub Actions interface.

## GitLab CI/CD

To add a Semgrep configuration snippet in your GitLab CI/CD pipeline:

1. Create or edit your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the repository you want to scan.
2. Copy the relevant code snippet provided in [Sample GitLab CI/CD configuration snippet](#sample-gitlab-cicd-configuration-snippet).
3. Commit the configuration file.
4. The Semgrep job starts automatically upon detecting the committed `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. You can also view the job from your GitLab project's **CI/CD > Pipelines** page.

## Jenkins

To add a Semgrep configuration snippet in your Jenkins pipeline:

1. Create or edit your `Jenkinsfile` configuration file in the repository you want to scan. You can also edit your `Jenkinsfile` from Jenkins's interface.
2. Copy the relevant code snippet provided in [Sample Jenkins configuration snippet](#sample-jenkins-configuration-snippet).
3. Commit the configuration file.
4. The Semgrep job starts automatically upon detecting the `Jenkinsfile` update.
5. Optional: Create a separate CI job for diff-aware scanning, which scans only changed files in PRs or MRs, by repeating steps 1-3 and uncommenting the `SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF` definition provided within the code snippet.

### Sample Jenkins configuration snippet

        // files in PRs or MRs (diff-aware scanning): 
        // SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF = "main"

        // Troubleshooting:

        // Uncomment the following lines if Semgrep App > Findings Page does not create links

## Buildkite

To add Semgrep into your Buildkite pipeline:

1. Create or edit a `pipeline.yml` configuration file to add a Semgrep command as part of your pipeline. Refer to the [BuildKite code snippet](#buildkite-code-snippet). This configuration file can also be stored within Buildkite.
2. Copy the relevant code snippet provided in [Sample Buildkite configuration snippet](#sample-buildkite-configuration-snippet).
3. If you are using Buildkite to store the configuration, save the file. Otherwise, commit the configuration file into the `/.buildkite` folder within the target repository.
4. The Semgrep job starts automatically upon detecting the committed `pipeline.yml` file. You can also view the job through BitBucket's interface, by clicking **your repository > Pipelines**. 
5. Optional: Create a separate CI job for diff-aware scanning, which scans only changed files in PRs or MRs, by repeating steps 1-3 and uncommenting the `SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF` definition provided within the code snippet.

## CircleCI

To add Semgrep into your CircleCI pipeline:

1. Create or edit your `config.yml` configuration file in the repository you want to scan.
2. Copy the relevant code snippet provided in [Sample CircleCI configuration snippet](#sample-circleci-configuration-snippet).
3. Commit the configuration file into the `/.circleci` folder within the target repository.
4. The Semgrep job starts automatically upon detecting the `config.yml` update.
5. Optional: Create a separate CI job for diff-aware scanning, which scans only changed files in PRs or MRs, by repeating steps 1-3 and uncommenting the `SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF` definition provided within the code snippet.

<!-- 

Note: CircleCI snippet does NOT set the SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN in the config file.
From CSE: 
It gets set from within the UI in the repository settings and automatically 
gets put into the pipeline at runtime.

## Azure Pipelines

To add Semgrep into Azure Pipelines:

1. Access the YAML pipeline editor within Azure Pipelines by following the [YAML pipeline editor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/yaml-pipeline-editor?view=azure-devops#edit-a-yaml-pipeline) guide.
2. Copy the relevant code snippet provided in [Sample Azure Pipelines configuration snippet](#sample-azure-pipelines-configuration-snippet) into the Azure Pipelines YAML editor.
3. Save the code snippet.
4. Set [environment variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch#secret-variables).
5. Group the environment variables as a [variable group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops&tabs=classic).
6. Optional: Create a separate CI job for diff-aware scanning, which scans only changed files in PRs or MRs, by repeating steps 1-4 and and adding `SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF` as an environment variable. 

### Sample Azure Pipelines configuration snippet

<Tabs
    defaultValue="azure-semgrep"
    values={[
    {label: 'CI with Semgrep App', value: 'azure-semgrep'},
    {label: 'Stand-alone CI job', value: 'azure-standalone'},
    ]}
>

<TabItem value='azure-semgrep'>


```yaml
# trigger:
#  - master

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest
variables:
- group: Semgrep app token group

steps: 

- script: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install semgrep
    semgrep ci
  env: 
    SEMGREP_PR_ID: $(System.PullRequest.PullRequestNumber)
```

### Setting environment variables in Azure Pipelines

Set these variables within Azure Pipelines UI following the steps in [Environment variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch#secret-variables):

* `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN`

Set these environment variables to troubleshoot the links to the code that generated a finding or if you are not receiving PR or MR comments:

* `SEMGREP_JOB_URL`
* `SEMGREP_COMMIT`
* `SEMGREP_BRANCH`
* `SEMGREP_REPO_URL`
* `SEMGREP_REPO_NAME`

Set this environment variable for diff-aware scanning:

* `SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF`. Its value is typically your trunkline branch, such as `main` or `master`.

## Other providers

To run Semgrep CI on any other provider, use the `returntocorp/semgrep` image, and run the `semgrep ci` command with `SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF` set for diff-aware scanning.

**Note**: If you need to use a different image than docker, install Semgrep CI by `pip install semgrep`.

Using the [configuration reference](../configuration-reference/), you can run Semgrep in the following CI providers:

- AppVeyor
- Bamboo 
- Bitrise
- Buildbot
- Codeship
- Codefresh
- TeamCity CI
- Travis CI
