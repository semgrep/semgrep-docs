<ScmFeatureReference />

<!-- The following list is not alphabetized. It is ranked based on popularity. -->
<!-- Titles for tabs are based on the most recognizable product name; they don't have to be parallel -->

## GitHub Actions

To add a Semgrep configuration file in your GitHub Actions pipeline:

1. Create a `semgrep.yml` file in `.github/workflows` in the repository you want to scan.
2. Copy the relevant code snippet provided in [Sample GitHub Actions configuration file](#sample-github-actions-configuration-file).
3. Paste the relevant code snippet to `semgrep.yml` file. This is your Semgrep configuration file for GitHub Actions.
4. Commit the configuration file under <code><span className="placeholder">/REPOSITORY-ROOT-DIRECTORY/.github/workflows/semgrep.yml</span></code>.
5. The Semgrep job starts automatically upon detecting the committed `semgrep.yml` file.

:::note
If you are self-hosting your repository, you must [use a self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/choosing-the-runner-for-a-job#choosing-self-hosted-runners).
:::

### Sample GitHub Actions configuration file

<Tabs
    defaultValue="gha-semgrep"
    values={[
    {label: 'Default', value: 'gha-semgrep'},
    {label: 'Semgrep OSS', value: 'gha-oss'},
    ]}
>

<TabItem value='gha-semgrep'>

The following configuration creates a CI job that runs scans depending on what products you have enabled in Semgrep AppSec Platform.

<GhaSemgrepAppSast />

You can **run specific product scans** by passing an argument, such as `--supply-chain`. View the [list of arguments](/getting-started/cli/#scan-using-specific-semgrep-products).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='gha-oss'>

The following configuration creates a CI job that runs Semgrep OSS scans using rules configured for your programming language.

<GhaSemgrepOssSast />

You can customize the scan by entering custom rules or other rulesets to scan with. See [Scan your codebase with a specific ruleset](/getting-started/cli-oss/#scan-your-codebase-with-a-specific-ruleset).

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::caution
If you define both `branches` or `branches-ignore` *and* `paths` or `paths-ignore`, the workflow only runs when both filters are satisfied.

For example, if your configuration file includes the following definition, the workflow runs only if there are changes on the `development` branch to `.github/workflows/semgrep.yml` :

```yaml
push:
  branches:
    - development
  paths:
    - .github/workflows/semgrep.yml
```

:::tip
If the pipeline's default runner runs out of memory, you can limit the number of subprocesses Semgrep uses with the [`-j` flag](/cli-reference), or [add the `size` directive](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/global-options/#Size) to the Semgrep step to increase the memory available:

```yaml
pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        size: 2x
        script:
          - echo "This step gets double the memory!"
```
:::

## Buildkite

To add Semgrep into your Buildkite pipeline:

1. Prepare a configuration file to add a Semgrep scan as part of your pipeline. This configuration file can be stored within Buildkite or as a `pipeline.yml` file in the target repository.
2. Copy the code snippet provided in [Sample Buildkite configuration snippet](#sample-buildkite-configuration-snippet), making alterations if necessary for your environment.
3. If you are using Buildkite to store the configuration, save the updated file. Otherwise, commit the updated `pipeline.yml` file into the `/.buildkite` folder within the target repository.
4. The Semgrep job starts automatically upon detecting the committed `pipeline.yml` file. Alternatively, if you are using the Buildkite UI, you can select **New build**. You can view the job through Buildkite's interface by clicking **Pipelines > pipeline name**.

:::note
These steps can be performed within Buildkite's UI. To do so, navigate to Buildkite's main page, and click **Pipelines > New Pipeline**.
:::

### Sample Buildkite configuration snippet

<!-- vale off -->

<Tabs
    defaultValue="buildkite-semgrep"
    values={[
    {label: 'Default', value: 'buildkite-semgrep'},
    {label: 'Semgrep OSS', value: 'buildkite-oss'},
    ]}
>

<!-- vale on -->

<TabItem value='buildkite-semgrep'>

The following configuration creates a CI job that runs scans according to the products you have enabled in Semgrep AppSec Platform. The provided environment variables are commonly needed to correctly configure scans from Buildkite.

This file configures two mutually exclusive command steps, one for full scans, and one for diff-aware scans. The latter is used for pull or merge requests.

In order for this configuration to run the correct type of scan for each condition, it requires both [branch filtering](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/branch-configuration) and configuration to build on pull requests.

#### Branch filtering

1. In the Buildkite UI, go to the pipeline **Settings** and select the connected source code manager in the left sidebar.
    ![Pipeline settings with example GitHub SCM](/img/buildkite-pipeline-settings.png#md-width)
    _**Figure.**_ Buildkite pipeline settings with using GitHub as the SCM.
2. Under **Branch Limiting**, enter your default branch name in the **Branch Filter Pattern** box. You can include any other branch names that require full scans as well, such as `release-*`.
    ![Branch limiting settings with example main branch](/img/buildkite-branch-settings.png#md-width)
    _**Figure.**_ Branch limiting settings with main as the example branch.
3. Click **Save Branch Limiting**.

#### Build on pull requests

To run diff-aware scans, your pipeline must run builds on pull or merge requests. Buildkite integrates with several source code managers and each one has different options to handle pull or merge requests. The most common options are a checkbox within the pipeline settings, or webhooks within the source control manager. Review the [documentation for your source control](https://buildkite.com/docs/integrations/source-control) system to ensure your Semgrep pipeline builds on pull or merge requests.

<BuildkiteSemgrepAppSast />

You can [run specific product scans by passing the appropriate argument](/getting-started/cli#scan-using-specific-semgrep-products), such as `--supply-chain`.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='buildkite-oss'>

The following configuration creates a CI job that runs Semgrep OSS scans using rules configured for your programming language.

<BuildkiteSemgrepOssSast />

You can customize the scan by entering custom rules or other rulesets to scan with. See [Scan your codebase with a specific ruleset](/getting-started/cli-oss/#scan-your-codebase-with-a-specific-ruleset).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## CircleCI

To add Semgrep into your CircleCI pipeline:

1. Create a [context](https://circleci.com/docs/contexts/):
    1. In CircleCI web app, click **Organization Settings** > **Contexts**.
    2. Click **Create Context**.
    3. Enter `semgrep` as the name for the context.
    4. Click **Add Environment Variable** and enter your `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN`.
2. Create or edit your `config.yml` configuration file in the repository you want to scan.
3. Copy the relevant code snippet provided in [Sample CircleCI configuration snippet](#sample-circleci-configuration-snippet).
4. If your default branch is not `main`, change the occurrences of `main` to the name of your default branch.
4. Commit the updated `config.yml` configuration file into the `/.circleci` folder in the target repository.
5. The Semgrep job starts automatically upon detecting the `config.yml` update.

The sample configuration provides jobs for both full scanning and [diff-aware scanning](/deployment/customize-ci-jobs#set-up-diff-aware-scans), which scans only changed files in PRs or MRs. You do not need to create any other jobs.

CircleCI runs the Semgrep job on all the commits for the project by default. If you want the job to scan only branches that have an associated a pull request open, you can enable the option "Only build pull requests" in **Project Settings** > **Advanced**.

:::note
For the default branch and tags, CircleCI always runs the Semgrep CI job on all commits.
:::

### Sample CircleCI configuration snippet

<Tabs
    defaultValue="circleci-semgrep"
    values={[
    {label: 'Default', value: 'circleci-semgrep'},
    {label: 'Semgrep OSS', value: 'circleci-oss'},
    ]}
>

<TabItem value='circleci-semgrep'>

The following configuration creates a CI job that runs scans depending on what products you have enabled in Semgrep AppSec Platform.

<CircleCiSemgrepAppSast />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='circleci-oss'>

The following configuration creates a CI job that runs Semgrep OSS scans using rules configured for your programming language.

<CircleCiSemgrepOssSast />

You can customize the scan by entering custom rules or other rulesets to scan with. See [Scan your codebase with a specific ruleset](/getting-started/cli-oss/#scan-your-codebase-with-a-specific-ruleset).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Azure Pipelines

:::info
Scanning a project with the `semgrep ci` command requires the project to be version-controlled by Git. If you have Azure Repos that are version-controlled with [Team Foundations Version Control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/what-is-tfvc?view=azure-devops), they must be migrated to Git to be scanned with `semgrep ci` and have results reported to the Semgrep AppSec Platform.
:::

To add Semgrep into Azure Pipelines:

1. Access the YAML pipeline editor within Azure Pipelines by following the [YAML pipeline editor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/yaml-pipeline-editor?view=azure-devops#edit-a-yaml-pipeline) guide.
2. Copy the relevant code snippet provided in [Sample Azure Pipelines configuration snippet](#sample-azure-pipelines-configuration-snippet) into the Azure Pipelines YAML editor.
3. Save the code snippet.
4. Set [environment variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch#secret-variables).
5. Group the environment variables as a [variable group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops&tabs=classic).
6. Optional: Create a separate CI job for diff-aware scanning, which scans only changed files in PRs or MRs, by repeating steps 1-4 and adding `SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF` as an environment variable.

### Sample Azure Pipelines configuration snippet

<Tabs
    defaultValue="azure-semgrep"
