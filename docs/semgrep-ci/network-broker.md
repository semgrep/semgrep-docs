# Set up the Semgrep network broker

The Semgrep network broker facilitates secure access between Semgrep and your private network. It accomplishes this by establishing a Wireguard VPN tunnel with the Semgrep infrastructure, then proxying **inbound** (from Semgrep to your network) HTTP requests through this tunnel. This approach allows Semgrep to interact with on-premise resources without having to expose them to the public internet.

Examples of inbound traffic include:

- Pull or merge request (PR or MR) comments
- JIRA integrations
- Webhooks

:::info Tier availability
The Semgrep network broker is available to Enterprise tier users.
:::
## Prerequisites

- The Semgrep Network Broker is a feature that must be enabled in your Semgrep organization (org) prior to set up. Contact the Semgrep team on [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Slack]( https://go.semgrep.dev/slack) or email [<i class="fa-regular fa-envelope"></i> support@semgrep.com](mailto:support@semgrep.com).
- **Docker** must be installed on the server where you want to install the network broker.

## Build

1. Log in to the server where you want to install the network broker.
1. Create a `config.yaml` file similar to the following snippet. Steps to generate values for the placeholders, such as `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY`, `YOUR_BASE_URL`, `YOUR_TOKEN`, are provided in succeeding sections of this guide.

    ```
    inbound:
      wireguard:
        localAddress: fdf0:59dc:33cf:9be8:yyyy:0:1
        privateKey: YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
        peers:
          - publicKey: 4EqJwDZ8X/qXB5u3Wpo2cxnKlysec93uhRvGWPix0lg=
            endpoint: wireguard.semgrep.dev:51820
            allowedIps: fdf0:59dc:33cf:9be9:0000:0000:0000:0001/128
      heartbeat:
        url: http://[fdf0:59dc:33cf:9be9:0000:0000:0000:0001]/ping
      allowlist: []
      gitlab:
        baseUrl: <https://gitlab.xxxx.net/api/v4>
        token: YOUR_TOKEN
    ```

- The `publicKey` should be entered as is:
`4EqJwDZ8X/qXB5u3Wpo2cxnKlysec93uhRvGWPix0lg=`

## Keypairs

The broker requires a Wireguard keypair to establish a secure connection.

To generate a public key:

```
docker run [ghcr.io/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker:](<http://ghcr.io/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker:latest>)[v0.14.0](<http://ghcr.io/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker:v0.14.0>) genkey
```

<aside> ðŸ’¡ The version in the example is v0.14.0. You can use the latest stable version of the network broker. Check here.
</aside>

To generate a private key:

```
echo xxxxxxx | sudo docker run -i [ghcr.io/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker:v0.14.0](<http://ghcr.io/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker:v0.14.0>) pubkey
```

<aside> ðŸ’¡ The xxxxx should be the generated public key
</aside>

:::info Tip 
Your public key is safe to share. _Do not_ share your private key with anyone (including Semgrep).
:::

Update the config.yaml with the private key:

Add the customer public key in the Semgrep Cloud Platform:

## Configuration

1. Update the `config.yaml` with the GitLab/Github URL:

![Screenshot 2024-01-17 at 11.34.23.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aeaf09c9-e827-4fed-b6a2-cc0fcc31bc3c/88dc88a1-6a3a-446a-a159-b5a9b33a853f/Screenshot_2024-01-17_at_11.34.23.png)

1. Update the `config.yaml` with a new GitLab/GitHub PAT token (User settingsâ†’Personal Access Token):

![Screenshot 2024-01-17 at 11.36.07.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aeaf09c9-e827-4fed-b6a2-cc0fcc31bc3c/7d27eb8d-7498-4ed7-bf65-e8f0983ec057/Screenshot_2024-01-17_at_11.36.07.png)

![Screenshot 2024-01-17 at 11.36.54.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aeaf09c9-e827-4fed-b6a2-cc0fcc31bc3c/21462d0b-e7f1-462e-9834-32e33ebec82b/Screenshot_2024-01-17_at_11.36.54.png)

ðŸ’¡ API scope is enough

1. Update the `config.yaml` with a local Address, basically it should be the local address: `fdf0:59dc:33cf:9be8:0:xxxx:0:1` where xxxx is the deployment_id in hexadecimal. Example: deployment id: 8849 in hexadecimal is 2291. 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ You can use some online utilities to this conversion, like [this](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html).

</aside>

1. Execute the following command to start with the broker:

`sudo docker run -d -it --rm -v $(pwd):/emt [ghcr.io/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker:v0.14.0](http://ghcr.io/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker:v0.14.0) -c /emt/config.yaml`

1. You can check the logs with `sudo docker logs xxxx` where `xxxx` is the container id
