# Set up the Semgrep network broker

The Semgrep network broker facilitates secure access between Semgrep and your private network. It accomplishes this by establishing a WireGuard VPN tunnel with the Semgrep infrastructure, then proxying **inbound** HTTP requests from Semgrep to your network through this tunnel. This approach allows Semgrep to interact with on-premise resources without exposing them to the public internet.

Examples of inbound traffic include:

- Pull request (PR) or merge request (MR) comments
- Jira integrations
- Webhooks

:::info Subscriber availability
The Semgrep network broker is available to Enterprise tier users.
:::

## Prerequisites

- The Semgrep Network Broker is a feature that must be enabled in your Semgrep organization (org) before set up. Contact the Semgrep team on [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Slack]( https://go.semgrep.dev/slack) or through email [<i class="fa-regular fa-envelope"></i> support@semgrep.com](mailto:support@semgrep.com).
- **Docker** must be installed on the server where you install the network broker.

## Configure Semgrep Broker

Ensure that you are logged in to and are completing the following steps on the server where you want to run Semgrep Broker.

1. Create a `config.yaml` file similar to the following snippet. The steps required to generate values for the placeholders, such as `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY`, `YOUR_BASE_URL`, `YOUR_TOKEN`, are provided in subsequent sections of this guide.

  ```yaml
  inbound:
    wireguard:
      localAddress: fdf0:59dc:33cf:9be8:yyyy:0:1
      privateKey: YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
      peers:
        - publicKey: 4EqJwDZ8X/qXB5u3Wpo2cxnKlysec93uhRvGWPix0lg=
          endpoint: wireguard.semgrep.dev:51820
          allowedIps: fdf0:59dc:33cf:9be9:0000:0000:0000:0001/128
    heartbeat:
      url: http://[fdf0:59dc:33cf:9be9:0000:0000:0000:0001]/ping
    allowlist: []
    gitlab:
      baseUrl: <https://gitlab.xxxx.net/api/v4>
      token: YOUR_TOKEN
  ```

  The `publicKey` should be entered precisely as follows:

  ```console
  4EqJwDZ8X/qXB5u3Wpo2cxnKlysec93uhRvGWPix0lg=
  ```

1. The broker requires a WireGuard keypair to establish a secure connection. To generate the public key:

   1. Get the [network broker version](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker/pkgs/container/semgrep-network-broker) you want to use. The format should be similar to `v0.14.0`.

   1. Run the following in the CLI to generate the public key, replacing the placeholder with the network broker version number:
  <pre class="language-console"><code>docker run ghcr.io/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker:<span className="placeholder">VERSION_NUMBER</span> genkey</code></pre>

1. Run the following in the CLI to generate the private key, replacing the placeholders with the public key you generated in the previous step and the network broker version number:

  <pre class="language-console"><code>echo <span className="placeholder">PUBLIC_KEY</span> | sudo docker run -i ghcr.io/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker:<span className="placeholder">VERSION_NUMBER</span> pubkey</code></pre>

  :::info Key sharing 
  Your public key is safe to share. Do **not** share your private key with anyone, including Semgrep.
  :::

1. Update the `config.yaml` file with the private key:

  ```yaml
  inbound:
    wireguard:
      localAddress: fdf0:59dc:33cf:9be8:yyyy:0:1
      privateKey: YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
      ...
  ```

1. Add the public key to the Semgrep Cloud Platform:
   1. Log into Semgrep Cloud Platform.
   2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Broker**.
   3. Paste your public key and click **Add Public Key**.

1. Update the `config.yaml` with your GitLab/Github URL:

  ```yaml
  gitlab:
    baseUrl: <https://gitlab.exampleCo.net/api/v4>
    token: YOUR_TOKEN
  ```

1. [Create a GitLab personal access token (PAT)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token) with the `api` scope, and add the token to `config.yaml` using the `token` field:

  ```yaml
  gitlab:
    baseUrl: <https://gitlab.xxxx.net/api/v4>
    token: YOUR_TOKEN
  ```

1. [Convert your deployment ID to hexadecimal](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html) for use in creating your deployment's local address:

  <pre class="language-console"><code>fdf0:59dc:33cf:9be8:0:<span className="placeholder">DEPLOYMENT_ID</span>:0:1</code></pre>
 
  Update the `localAddress` field of `config.yaml`; 

  ```yaml
  inbound:
    wireguard:
      localAddress: fdf0:59dc:33cf:9be8:0:DEPLOYMENT_ID:0:1
  ```

1. Run the following command to start Semgrep Broker with your updated configuration file:

  <pre class="language-console"><code>sudo docker run -d -it --rm -v $(pwd):/emt ghcr.io/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker:<span className="placeholder">VERSION_NUMBER</span> -c /emt/config.yaml</code></pre>

## Check Semgrep Broker logs

You can check the logs for Semgrep Broker by running:

<pre class="language-console"><code>sudo docker logs <span className="placeholder">CONTAINER_ID</span></code></pre>
