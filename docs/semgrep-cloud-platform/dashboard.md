# Evaluating your security posture through the Dashboard

The Findings Dashboard is an overview of your organization’s security posture from data aggregated within Semgrep Cloud Platform. With these metrics you can:

* View recurring security issues, consequently taking action on them.
* Improve communication between developer teams and security teams.
* Detect vulnerabilities early, thereby preventing these from persisting through to the next stage of product delivery, such as QA.

You can access the Dashboard by [logging into Semgrep Cloud Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login?return_path=/manage/projects).

## Assessing security readiness at a glance

![Screenshot of dashboard header](/img/dashboard-header.png)

The **Header widget** displays high-level security analytics across your entire organization. This includes:
<dl>
	<dt>Open findings</dt>
	<dd>The number of open findings over the <b>given time period</b> next to the calendar icon. The badge number indicates whether this number has gone up or down compared to the previous timeframe. The number badge compares the most recent number of open findings against the previous timeframe.</dd>
	<dt>High severity</dt>
	<dd><a href='/semgrep-code/findings/#understanding-the-findings-data'>High severity findings</a> are findings generated by a rule with the severity value set to <code>ERROR</code>. These include security backdoors, highly vulnerable code, and so on. The number badge compares the number of high severity findings within the given time period against the previous time period.</dd>
	<dt>Pull request (PR) fix rate</dt>
	<dd>The percentage of findings that were fixed when findings were surfaced to developers via PR comments in previous scans. The number badge compares PR fix rate in the given time period against the previous time period.</dd>
</dl>

## Filtering findings by time

The Dashboard displays data from scans for the **last one month** by default. This time range can be set to a broader or narrower value. By broadening the time range, security teams are able to see total numbers and statistics across an entire time period. Narrow time ranges can give insights into the most recent vulnerabilities creeping into the project.

To change the time range of scan data over time:

1. Click the <i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-days"></i> **Last 1 month** button.
2. Select a time range from the drop-down box. The Dashboard, including all widgets, reloads to reflect data from the selected time period.

## Filtering findings by projects

The Dashboard displays data from scans for **all of the organization's projects** by default. Select one or a few projects to filter the dashboard widgets to only reflect scans from selected projects. Selecting a few projects gives you a more targeted view of those projects' security posture.

To change the projects filter:

1. Click the <i class="fa-solid fa-sliders"></i> **All projects** button.
2. Select the project(s) from the drop-down box. The Dashboard, including all widgets, reloads to reflect data from the selected project(s).

## Summarizing a project’s security posture

The **Projects widget** displays open findings, high severities, and PR fix rates per-project. Through this view you can see which projects have the amount number of findings. The columns are arranged in a descending order, from the project with the greatest amount of findings to the least.

To view the project’s findings, click on the project’s name. This takes you to the [Findings page](/semgrep-code/findings), where you can filter, sort, and triage findings.

## Assessing rule performance

The **Rules widget** provides a summary report for rule metrics, such as what rules are ignored or fired the most.

These data points can serve as a starting point for the following security audits:

- Investigating the relevance or quality of a rule — is it useful, or does it detect too many false positives?
- Are there underlying issues in the codebase that result in recurring patterns of insecure code?
- Are there rules that developers don’t resolve? Semgrep helps identify these, which helps to form insights into possible causes.

### Rule performance through Developer Feedback

![Screenshot of developer feedback](/img/dashboard-devfeedback.png)

In Team/Enterprise Dashboards, these additional metrics are visible:

* Most disliked
* Slowest

The **Most disliked** metric is taken from the **Developer Feedback** feature. Developers are able to provide feedback on findings that are not the most accurate. This feature is available for Team/Enterprise users.
