# Enabling Bitbucket pull request comments

Semgrep can create **pull request (PR) comments** in your Bitbucket repository. These comments inform your developers of **findings**, such as security issues, in their PRs. Semgrep can also provide remediation tips or code fixes that your developers can click to **commit** into their code directly.

:::info Prerequisites
* You must have a Bitbucket Cloud Free, Standard, or Premium plan. Bitbucket Data Center is not supported. 
* Bitbucket PR comments can only be enabled through Semgrep Cloud Platform (SCP). [Create an account](/semgrep-code/getting-started/) to set up Slack notifications.
* To receive alerts and notifications, you must [add or onboard a project](/semgrep-code/getting-started/) (repository) to Semgrep Cloud Platform for scanning.

| Type of scan | Product name | Trigger condition | How to set up |
| --  | -- |  -- | --- |
| Static application security testing (SAST) | Semgrep Code | A PR comment appears when a finding is generated by a rule in **Comment or Block mode**. This means you can fully customize what comments your developers receive. | Complete the steps in this guide. |
| Software composition analysis (SCA) | Semgrep Supply Chain (SSC) | A PR comment appears only when the finding is **reachable**. | Complete the steps in this guide.  |
| Secrets | Semgrep Secrets (beta) | A PR comment appears on validated secrets. | This product is in beta.<br /> Contact [<i class="fa-regular fa-envelope"></i> support@semgrep.com](mailto:support@semgrep.com) to enable PR comments.  |

There are two ways in which you can integrate Semgrep comments into Bitbucket Cloud depending on the Bitbucket plan you use:

- **Workspace access token**: If you use the Bitbucket Cloud Premium plan, you can create a workspace access token. This option saves time because you can create one access token for all repositories in the workspace. With one workspace access token, you can bulk-onboard more repositories at once from a whole workspace. See [Creating a workspace access token](/semgrep-code/notifications/#creating-and-adding-a-workspace-access-token). However, you can also use the option of a repository access token to onboard repositories one by one.
- **Repository access token**: If you do **not** have the Bitbucket Cloud Premium plan, create a separate repository access token for each repository where you want to use Semgrep. This configuration option is also useful if you have the Bitbucket Cloud Premium plan, but prefer to onboard repositories one by one instead of bulk onboarding. See [Creating a repository access token](/semgrep-code/notifications/#creating-and-adding-a-repository-access-token).

## Creating and adding a workspace access token

:::info Prerequisite
- **Bitbucket Cloud Premium** plan. If you do not have a Bitbucket Cloud Premium plan, create a repository access token.
:::

Create a workspace access token in Bitbucket (only available if you have a Bitbucket Cloud Premium plan). Fulfill these general steps to create a workspace access token:

1. Create a workspace access token in Bitbucket with **Read** and **Write** permissions for pull requests. Follow the instructions in [Create a workspace Access Token](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/create-a-workspace-access-token/) in Bitbucket documentation.
1. Add the workspace access token as a workspace variable with the **Secured** option.

To complete the configuration, follow the [Enabling PR comments in Bitbucket Cloud](#enabling-pr-comments-in-bitbucket-cloud) section.

This section helps you to configure PR comments if you do **not** have a Bitbucket Cloud Premium plan. You can create a separate repository access token for each repository where you want to use Semgrep. This configuration option is also useful if you have the Bitbucket Cloud Premium plan, but prefer to onboard repositories one by one instead of bulk onboarding.

## Enabling PR comments in Bitbucket Cloud

:::info Prerequisite
* You must have a Bitbucket Cloud [workspace access token](/semgrep-code/notifications/#creating-and-adding-a-workspace-access-token) or a [repository access token](/semgrep-code/notifications/#creating-and-adding-a-repository-access-token).
:::

To enable PR comments, define the `BITBUCKET_TOKEN` environment variable in your CI configuration file. Its syntax and placement in your CI configuration file depends on your CI provider. For example, in Bitbucket Pipelines, its syntax is the following:

```
- export BITBUCKET_TOKEN=$PAT
```

The following snippet is a sample with `BITBUCKET_TOKEN` defined in a `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file:

<!-- 
<Tabs
    defaultValue="jenkins"
    values={[
    {label: 'Sample Jenkins snippet', value: 'jenkins'},
    {label: 'Sample Bitbucket Pipelines snippet', value: 'pipelines'},
    ]}
>

<TabItem value='jenkins'>

```javascript
pipeline {
  agent any
    environment {

      SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN = credentials('SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN')
      // Define BITBUCKET_TOKEN to receive PR comments for Bitbucket Cloud
      BITBUCKET_TOKEN = credentials('BITBUCKET_PAT')

      // ... Other configuration variables
    }
    stages {
      stage('Semgrep-Scan') {
        steps {
          sh 'pip3 install semgrep'
          sh 'semgrep ci'
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value='pipelines'>

-->
```yaml
image: atlassian/default-image:latest

pipelines:
  branches:
    main:
      # ...
  pull-requests:
    '**':
      - step:
          name: 'Run Semgrep diff scan with PR branch'
          image: returntocorp/semgrep
          script:
            # ...
            - export BITBUCKET_TOKEN=$PAT
```

<!--
</TabItem>

</Tabs>
-->

After defining the `BITBUCKET_TOKEN`, you have successfully set up PR comments in Bitbucket Cloud.

:::info
Only rules set to the **Comment** and **Block** rule modes in the [Policies page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/policies) create PR comments.
