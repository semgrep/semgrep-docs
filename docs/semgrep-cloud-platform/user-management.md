# User management, accounts, and roles 

Accounts enable you to manage access to Semgrep resources, such as scans and findings, with varying levels of collaboration and visibility.

Semgrep Cloud Platform has two types of accounts:

<dl>
    <dt>Personal account</dt>
    <dd>Every person who signs into Semgrep Cloud Platform is first signed in to a <strong>personal account</strong>. In a personal account, your findings, projects, private rules, and scans are visible only to you.</dd>
    <dt>Organization (Org) account</dt>
    <dd>To collaborate with others, create an <strong>organization account</strong>. An organization account in Semgrep Cloud Platform requires an existing organization from GitHub or GitLab. Creating this type of account integrates Semgrep Cloud Platform with your organization. A user can be part of many Semgrep Cloud Platform organization accounts, provided that they are a member of that organization in their SCM (source code management) tool, such as GitHub or GitLab. Semgrep Cloud Platform can also detect the organization's repositories available for scanning.</dd>
</dl>

In organization accounts, collaborators can collectively manage Semgrep Cloud Platform. By default, users can:

* Add projects to scan.
* View and triage findings.
* Determine what rules to run and set up actions that Semgrep Cloud Platform will perform.
* Manage tokens and other settings.
* View an organization's private rules.

Semgrep Cloud Platform can restrict features based on user roles. See [Controlling access through roles](#controlling-access-through-roles).

## Setting up a Semgrep organization account

By setting up an organization account, teams can collaborate on rule writing and the management of repositories. Teams with organization accounts can enforce organization-wide standards and secure their repositories at scale. Perform the steps outlined in the following subsections to set up an organization account.

### Creating a Semgrep organization account

:::note
- Semgrep supports the creation of organization accounts from GitHub or GitLab only.
:::

To create an organization account:

1. Sign in to Semgrep Cloud Platform.
2. On the sidebar, click **your account name > Add org**.
3. Choose **Create an organization**.
4. Enter the **Organization Display Name**. Typically the organization display name matches the name of the organization in your SCM, but this is not required.
5. Click **Create**.

You have successfully connected an organization account.

### Connecting a Semgrep organization account to your SCM

This step connects a source code manager, such as GitHub, to your Semgrep organization account. Linking a source code manager allows the Semgrep org's membership to be managed by GitHub or GitLab. After connecting your Semgrep org to GitHub or GitLab, members from GitHub or GitLab are able to join the Semgrep organization you created previously.

1. Sign in to Semgrep Cloud Platform.
2. On the sidebar, click **your account name** > **the organization account** you created.
3. Click **Settings** > **Source code**.
4. Click on your Source code manager, for example, **Connect to GitHub**.
5. Click an organization to link. You are signed out of Semgrep Cloud Platform automatically as your credentials have changed after linking an organization.
6. Sign back in to Semgrep Cloud Platform.

You have successfully connected an org in Semgrep Cloud Platform with an organization in your source code management tool.

### Joining a Semgrep organization

If a Semgrep organization has been connected to GitHub or GitLab, members of the org in GitHub or GitLab can join the Semgrep organization. To join a Semgrep org account, perform the following steps:

1. Sign in to Semgrep Cloud Platform.
2. On the sidebar, click **your account name > Add org**.
3. Choose **Join an organization**. A list of possible orgs to join appears.
4. Click the organization you want to join. You are signed out of Semgrep Cloud Platform automatically as your credentials change after linking an organization.
6. Sign back in to Semgrep Cloud Platform.

You have successfully joined an org in Semgrep Cloud Platform.

## Controlling access through roles 

Access control in Semgrep Cloud Platform determines the resources and features that are available to users based on their role. This **role-based access control (RBAC)** feature is available for organizations on **Team/Enterprise tiers**.

![Screenshot of role-based access control](/img/rbac-overview.png)<br />

Semgrep Cloud Platform divides users into two roles:

* `admin`
* `member`

:::info
* Users in organizations without RBAC enabled are assigned an `admin` role by default.
* Community-tier (Free) users are assigned an `admin` role by default.
:::

The following table displays features available to each role:

| Feature               | `member`  | `admin`   | Additional notes                                                                   |
| ---------             | --------- | --------- | ---------                                                                          |

| Projects              | no        | yes       | Only `admin` can manage projects.                                                  |
| Rule Board (Policies) | no        | yes       | Only `admin` can manage policies and rules.                                        |
| Findings              | yes       | yes       | Both `admin` and `member` roles can sort, filter, comment on, and triage findings. |
| Editor                | yes       | yes       | `member` roles are able to write and modify rules within an organization.          |
| Settings              | no        | yes       |                                                                                    |
| Community             | yes       | yes       |                                                                                    |
| Registry              | yes       | yes       |                                                                                    |
| Playground            | yes       | yes       |                                                                                    |
| Docs                  | yes       | yes       |                                                                                    |

To enable RBAC, please contact r2c at [support@semgrep.com](mailto:support@semgrep.com).

Upon enabling RBAC for the first time, current members of the organization are `admins`. New members added thereafter are automatically `members`.

### Member-scoped access tokens

Both members and admins can log in through the CLI by entering the following command:

```
semgrep login
```

This generates a unique token that is used to identify a member or admin. When logged in, members can run scans on their local machine through the `semgrep ci` command. This sends findings data to Semgrep Cloud Platform.

Only admin users can view member tokens in the **Settings > Tokens** tab. A token's access cannot be escalated to an admin-level token. A user must first obtain the admin role and then create a new token as an admin. See the following section on [Changing a user's role](/semgrep-cloud-platform/user-management/#changing-a-users-role).

Additionally, only admin users can make changes to the [Rule board](/semgrep-code/rule-board).

## Changing a user's role

:::info Prerequisites
* You must be an `admin` to perform this operation.
* You may need to log out and log back in after enabling RBAC for your organization.
:::

To **change a user's role**:

1. On Semgrep Cloud Platform's sidebar, click Settings.
2. Click on the Members tab.
3. Search for the member whose role will be changed.
4. Click on the member's current role, under the role header. A drop-down box appears.
5. Select the new role for the member.

:::info
You cannot change your own role.
