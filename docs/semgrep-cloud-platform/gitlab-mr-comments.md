# Enabling GitLab merge request comments

:::info Prerequisites
* Pull request (PR) comments can only be enabled through Semgrep Cloud Platform (SCP). [Create an account](/semgrep-code/getting-started/#signing-in-to-semgrep-cloud-platform) to set up Slack notifications.
* To receive alerts and notifications, you must [add or onboard a project](/semgrep-code/getting-started/#option-b-adding-a-repository-from-github-gitlab-or-bitbucket) (repository) to Semgrep Cloud Platform for scanning.
:::

This section documents how to enable Semgrep Cloud Platform to post comments on merge requests.

Automated comments on GitLab merge requests are displayed as follows:

To enable GitLab merge request comments, follow these steps:

1. In GitLab, go to [Profile > Access Tokens](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens), and then add a token with `api` scope.
1. Copy the token created in the previous step.
1. Navigate to **Your repository** >  **Settings** > **CI/CD**. The URL of the page where you are ends with: `/username/project/-/settings/ci_cd`.
1. Under **Variables** click **Expand**, and then click **Add variable**.
1. Enter **PAT** (change this placeholder name as necessary) in the **Key** field and paste the token value copied in step two to the **Value** field.
1. Select the **Mask variable** checkbox option, and then clear the **Protect variable** checkbox option.
1. Update your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with variable `GITLAB_TOKEN` and value `$PAT`. Refer to the following example:
```yaml
semgrep:
  # A Docker image with Semgrep installed.
  image: returntocorp/semgrep
  # Run the "semgrep ci" command on the command line of the docker image.
  script: semgrep ci

  rules:
  # Scan changed files in MRs, (diff-aware scanning):
  - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID

  # Scan mainline (default) branches and report all findings.
  - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH

  variables:
    # Connect to Semgrep Cloud Platform through your SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN.
    # Generate a token from Semgrep Cloud Platform > Settings
    # and add it as a variable in your GitLab CI/CD project settings.
    SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN: $SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN
    # Receive inline MR comments (requires Semgrep Cloud Platform account)
    GITLAB_TOKEN: $PAT
```
Substitute the placeholder <code><span className="placeholder">PAT</span></code> with the name you created for this variable.

For more configuration options, see [GitLab CI Sample](/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#gitlab-ci).

:::info
Only rules in the **Comment** and **Block** columns of your [Policies](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/board) create MR comments.

## Enabling autofix in GitLab repositories

[Autofix](/writing-rules/autofix) is a Semgrep feature in which rules contain suggested fixes to resolve findings.

## Dataflow traces in MR comments

### Viewing the path of tainted data in MR comments

To enable dataflow traces in your CI pipeline, fulfill the following prerequisites:

:::info Prerequisites
- Enable GitLab merge request Semgrep comments. For more details, see [Enabling GitLab merge request comments](#enabling-gitlab-merge-request-comments) section.
- To obtain meaningful results of dataflow traces in MR comments, use Semgrep Pro Engine while scanning your repositories to display cross-file (interfile) findings. To enable Semgrep Pro Engine, see [Semgrep Pro Engine overview](/semgrep-code/semgrep-pro-engine-intro/).
- Not all Semgrep rules or rulesets make use of taint tracking. Ensure that you have a ruleset, such as the **default ruleset** added in your **[Policies](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/board)**. If this ruleset is not added, go to [https://semgrep.dev/p/default](https://semgrep.dev/p/default), and then click **Add to Policy**. You can add rules that use taint tracking from [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore).
