# Set up GitHub pull request comments
<!--  The entire process of setting up the GH comment is more than just "enabling it", ie. turning it on. Users have to set up the rules. So I changed the verb. -->

:::info Prerequisites
* Pull request (PR) comments can only be set up through Semgrep Cloud Platform (SCP). [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Create an account](/semgrep-code/getting-started/#signing-in-to-semgrep-cloud-platform) to set up PR comments.
* You must add or onboard a Project (repository) to SCP and it must complete at least one full scan successfully.
:::

Semgrep can create **Pull request (PR) comments** in your GitHub repository. These comments inform your developers of **findings**, such as security issues, in their PRs. Semgrep can also provide remediation tips or code fixes that your developers can click to **commit** into their code directly.

## Conditions for PR comment creation

PR comments appear for the following types of scans and under certain conditions:

| Type of scan | Product name | Trigger condition | How to set up |
| --  | -- |  -- | --- |
| Static application security testing (SAST) | Semgrep Code | A PR comment appears when a finding is generated by a rule in **Comment or Block mode**. This means you can fully customize what comments your developers receive. | Complete the steps in the following sections: <ol><li>[Confirm your Semgrep account's connection and access to GitHub](#confirm-account-connection-and-access).</li><li>[Configure PR comments for Semgrep Code](#configure-pr-comments-for-semgrep-code).</li></ol> |
| Software composition analysis (SCA) | Semgrep Supply Chain (SSC) | A PR comment appears only when the finding is **reachable**. | Complete the steps in [Confirm account connection and access](##confirm-account-connection-and-access).  |
| Secrets | Semgrep Secrets (beta) | A PR comment appears on validated secrets. | This product is in beta.<br /> Contact [<i class="fa-regular fa-envelope"></i> support@semgrep.com](mailto:support@semgrep.com) to enable PR comments.  |

Automated comments on GitHub pull requests are displayed as follows:

## Confirm account connection and access

### Confirm your Semgrep account's connection to GitHub

PR comments are enabled by default for users who have connected their GitHub organization (org) to Semgrep Cloud Platform. Confirm that you have the correct connection and access:

1. In your SCP account, click **Settings > Source code managers**.
2. Check that an entry for your GitHub org exists and is correct.

If you have not connected your GitHub org, follow the steps in [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Adding an organization](/semgrep-cloud-platform/getting-started/#adding-an-organization).

If you are using a **self-hosted GitHub plan**, such as **GitHub Enterprise Server**, perform the steps in [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Receiving PR or MR comments in your VPN or on-premise SCM](/semgrep-cloud-platform/scm/#receiving-pr-or-mr-comments-in-your-vpn-or-on-premise-scm) to finish setting up the connection from Semgrep to your GitHub instance.

### Confirm repository access

Ensure that Semgrep's GitHub app (`semgrep-app`) has sufficient permissions to post PR comments:

1. Navigate to your `semgrep-app` settings:
	1. For personal accounts, navigate to the following URL `https://github.com/settings/installations`.
	2. For organization accounts, navigate to the following URL, substituting YOUR_ORG_NAME with the name of your account: `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORG_NAME/settings/installations`.
2. On the `semgrep-app` row, click Configure.
3. Check that you have granted the following permission: `Read and write access to actions, pull requests, secrets, security events, and workflows`.
4. Under **Repository access**, check that you have included the repositories that you added to Semgrep Cloud Platform.

For GitHub Actions users, no further steps need to be undertaken. Continue setting up Semgrep Code PR comments by [setting rules to Comment or Block mode](#set-rules-to-comment-or-block-mode).

### Define environment variables needed to connect Semgrep to other CI providers

For CI providers aside from GitHub Actions, additional environment variables must be set.

After performing all the steps in Configure PR comments, define the following environment variables:

- `SEMGREP_PR_ID` is set to the PR number of the pull request on GitHub (for example, `2901`)
- `SEMGREP_REPO_NAME` is set to the repository name (for example, `returntocorp/semgrep`)
- `SEMGREP_REPO_URL` is set to the repository URL where your project is viewable online (for example, `https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep`)

These values do not have to be fixed or hardcoded. They can be variables passed to the job. For more information, see [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Sample CI configurations](/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs).


## Configure PR comments for Semgrep Code

In addition to setting up the connection between Semgrep and GitHub, you must assign rules to Comment or Block mode. This customization enables you to:

- Manage the **amount of PR comments** your developers receive.
- Ensure that only rules that meet your criteria, such as high severity or high confidence rules, produce comments visible to developers, reducing noise.

:::tip
Rules in **Block mode** prevent the PR from being merged without triage or remediation.
:::

### Set rules to Comment or Block mode

The following instructions let you customize what findings or security issues your developers see as comments in their PRs:

1. In your SCP account, click **Rules > Policies**. You are taken to the **Policies** page. Under **Modes ⚙**, you can quickly see if you have existing rules in either Comment or Block mode.
1. Optional: Use the filters to quickly find rules to set to Comment or Block.
1. Click the **<i class="fa-solid fa-square-check"></i> checkbox** of the rules you want to set. You can use <kbd>Ctrl + Click</kbd> to select rules in bulk.
1. Click **Change modes**.
2. Click either **Block** or **Comment**.

You have successfully configured PR comments for Semgrep Code. If you are using **GitHub Actions** to run Semgrep, no extra changes are needed to receive PR comments.


### Enable autofix in GitHub repositories

[Autofix](/writing-rules/autofix) is a Semgrep feature in which rules contain suggested fixes to resolve findings.

<EnableAutofix />

### Dataflow traces in PR comments

#### View the path of tainted data in PR comments

To enable dataflow traces feature in your CI pipeline, fulfill the following prerequisites:

:::info Prerequisites
- Enable GitHub pull request Semgrep comments, as described on this page.
- To obtain meaningful results of dataflow traces in PR comments, use Semgrep Pro Engine while scanning your repositories to display cross-file (interfile) findings. To enable Semgrep Pro Engine, see [Semgrep Pro Engine overview](/semgrep-code/semgrep-pro-engine-intro/).
- Not all Semgrep rules or rulesets make use of taint tracking. Ensure that you have a ruleset that does, such as the **default ruleset**, added in your **[Policies](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/policies)**. To add this ruleset, navigate to [https://semgrep.dev/p/default](https://semgrep.dev/p/default), and then click **Add to Policies**.
- You can add additional rules that use taint tracking from [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore).
:::


## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that you have followed all the necessary steps in this guide.
- For **Semgrep Code** scans:
    - Ensure that the findings are from rules in your Comment or Block columns.
- For **Semgrep Supply Chain** users:
    - Refer to the [trigger conditions](#conditions-for-pr-comment-creation) and ensure that the finding is in a **new line of code in the PR**.
