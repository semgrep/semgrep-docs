Semgrep is a fast, open-source, static analysis engine for finding bugs, detecting dependency vulnerabilities, and enforcing code standards. [Get started ‚Üí](/getting-started/quickstart)

Semgrep analyzes code locally on your computer or in your build environment: **code is never uploaded**.

Its rules look like the code you already write; no abstract syntax trees, regex wrestling, or painful DSLs. Here's a rule for finding Python `print()` statements. Run it by clicking the [‚ñ∏] button:

The Semgrep ecosystem includes the following products:

- [Semgrep OSS Engine](/getting-started/quickstart) - The open-source engine at the heart of everything.
- [Semgrep Cloud Platform (SCP)](/semgrep-cloud-platform/getting-started) - Deploy, manage, and monitor SAST, SCA, and leaked secrets at scale using Semgrep Integrates with continuous integration (CI) providers such as GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI, and more.
- [Semgrep Code](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-code) - Scan your code with Semgrep's Pro rules and Semgrep Pro Engine to find OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and protect against critical security risks specific to your organization.
    - [Semgrep Pro rules](/semgrep-code/pro-rules) - High-confidence rules written by Semgrep Security Research team for a variety of languages
    - [Semgrep Pro Engine](/semgrep-code/semgrep-pro-engine-intro) - Advanced engine that performs interfile and interprocedural analysis
- [Semgrep Supply Chain (SSC)](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-supply-chain) - A high-signal dependency scanner that detects reachable vulnerabilities in open source third-party libraries and functions across the software development life cycle (SDLC).
- [Semgrep Secrets](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-secrets) - A secrets scanner that detects valid secrets in your codebase through semantic analysis, entropy analysis, and validation. 

:::tip
The following products are **free** for up to 10 contributors:
* Semgrep Cloud Platform
* Semgrep Code
* Semgrep Secrets
:::

Support and be supported by the Semgrep community through:

## History

Semgrep is an evolution of [pfff](https://github.com/returntocorp/pfff/), which began at [Facebook](https://github.com/facebookarchive/pfff) in 2009, which itself was an evolution of the Linux refactoring tool [Coccinelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccinelle_(software)). [Semgrep, Inc](https://r2c.dev/team) revitalized the project after its original author, [Yoann Padioleau](https://github.com/aryx), joined the company.

## Semgrep development philosophy

See the [Semgrep OSS Engine Philosophy](contributing/semgrep-philosophy/) for details about why Semgrep is free, our goals for development, and the designed capabilities and limits of the static analysis engine.
