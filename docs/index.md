Semgrep is an AppSec suite for finding bugs, detecting dependency vulnerabilities, and enforcing code standards. <!-- Semgrep analyzes code locally on your computer or in your build environment: **code is never uploaded**. --> Its rules look like the code you already write -- no abstract syntax trees, regex wrestling, or painful DSLs. 

The following code editor shows a rule for finding Python `print()` statements. Run it by clicking the [‚ñ∏] button:

<!-- The Semgrep ecosystem includes the following products:-->

The Semgrep ecosystem includes:

- [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login) - Deploy, manage, and monitor Code, Supply Chain, and Secrets at scale. Semgrep integrates with continuous integration (CI) providers such as GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI, and more.
- [Semgrep Code](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-code) - Scan your code with Semgrep to find OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and protect against critical security risks specific to your organization.
- [Semgrep Secrets](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-secrets) - Detect and validate leaked credentials in your codebase.
- [Semgrep Supply Chain (SSC)](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-supply-chain) - A high-signal dependency scanner to reachable vulnerabilities in open source third-party libraries and functions.

Semgrep AppSec Platform, Code, and Supply Chain are **free** for up to 10 contributors. [Get started ‚Üí](/getting-started/quickstart)


<!-- 
Support and be supported by the Semgrep community through:

* [Semgrep Playground](https://semgrep.dev/editor) - An online interactive tool for writing and sharing rules.
* [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) - 2,000+ community-driven rules covering security, correctness, and dependency vulnerabilities.

Semgrep is developed and commercially supported by [Semgrep, Inc](https://semgrep.dev) a software security company.

## History

Semgrep is an evolution of [pfff](https://github.com/semgrep/pfff/), which began at [Facebook](https://github.com/facebookarchive/pfff) in 2009, which itself was an evolution of the Linux refactoring tool [Coccinelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccinelle_(software)). [Semgrep, Inc](https://semgrep.dev/about) revitalized the project after its original author, [Yoann Padioleau](https://github.com/aryx), joined the company.

## Semgrep development philosophy

See the [Semgrep OSS Engine Philosophy](contributing/semgrep-philosophy/) for details about why Semgrep is free, our goals for development, and the designed capabilities and limits of the static analysis engine.
