<h3 align="center">Static analysis at ludicrous speed<br />Find bugs and enforce code standards</h3>

Semgrep is a fast, open-source, static analysis tool for finding bugs and enforcing code standards at editor, commit, and CI time. [Get started ‚Üí](getting-started/)

Semgrep analyzes code locally on your computer or in your build environment: **code is never uploaded**. 

Its rules look like the code you already write; no abstract syntax trees, regex wrestling, or painful DSLs. Here's a quick rule for finding Python `print()` statements, run it by clicking the [‚ñ∏] button:

<!-- <EditorWidget snippetId={"ievans:print-to-logger2"} /> -->

The Semgrep ecosystem includes:

* [Semgrep](getting-started/) - the open-source command line tool at the heart of everything
* [Semgrep CI](semgrep-ci/overview/) - a specialized Docker image for running Semgrep in CI environments
* [Semgrep Playground](https://semgrep.dev/editor) - an online interactive tool for writing and sharing rules
* [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) - 2,000+ community-driven rules covering security, correctness, and performance bugs
* [Semgrep App](https://semgrep.dev/manage) - deploy, manage, and monitor Semgrep at scale with free and paid tiers

Semgrep is developed and commercially supported by [r2c, a software security company](https://r2c.dev).

To determine experimental, beta, or general availability (GA) status we scan a wide corpus of projects and measure the parse rate of each language. For more details see [the breakdown of all supported languages](supported-languages/).

## History

Semgrep is an evolution of [pfff](https://github.com/returntocorp/pfff/), which began at [Facebook](https://github.com/facebookarchive/pfff) in 2009, which itself was an evolution of the Linux refactoring tool [Coccinelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccinelle_(software)). [r2c](https://r2c.dev/team) revitalized the project after its original author, [Yoann Padioleau](https://github.com/aryx), joined the company.

## Understanding Semgrep development philosophy

See the [Semgrep CLI Philosophy](contributing/semgrep-philosophy/) for details about why Semgrep is free, our goals for development, and the designed capabailities and limits of the static analysis engine.
