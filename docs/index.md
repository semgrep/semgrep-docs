# Overview


Semgrep is a fast, open-source, static analysis tool that excels at expressing code standards â€” without complicated queries â€” and surfacing bugs early at editor, commit, and CI time. Precise rules look like the code youâ€™re searching; no more traversing abstract syntax trees or wrestling with regexes.

Semgrep encompasses:

* [Semgrep CLI](getting-started.md) - the [open-source](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep) command-line tool at the heart of everything
* [Semgrep CI](integrations.md) - an adaptation of Semgrep CLI for continuously scanning commits and builds
* [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore): 900+ rules written by the Semgrep community and [r2c](https://r2c.dev) that cover security, correctness, and performance bugs. No need to DIY unless you want to.
* [Semgrep Community & Semgrep Team](https://semgrep.dev/manage) - hosted services with free and paid tiers to help write and share rules, and centrally manage Semgrep CI across many projects

Semgrep CLI is an evolution of [pfff](https://github.com/returntocorp/pfff/), which began at [Facebook](https://github.com/facebookarchive/pfff) in 2009, which itself was an evolution of the Linux refactoring tool [Coccinelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccinelle_(software)). r2c revitalized the project after its original author, [Yoann Padioleau](https://github.com/aryx), joined the company.

# Language support

Some supported languages are in alpha or beta; we take a data-driven approach that evaluates the parse rate of the language on a wide corpus before we promote it to general availability (GA). For more details, see [our breakdown of all supported languages](status.md).
