# Overview


Semgrep is a fast, open-source, static analysis tool for finding bugs and enforcing code standards at editor, commit, or CI time. Its rules look like the code you’re searching; no more traversing abstract syntax trees or wrestling with regexes.

Semgrep runs locally or in your build environment: code is never sent anywhere. It encompasses:

* [Semgrep CLI](getting-started.md) - the [open-source](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep) command-line tool at the heart of everything
* [Semgrep CI](semgrep-ci.md) - Semgrep for continuously scanning commits and builds
* [Semgrep App](https://semgrep.dev/manage) - hosted app with free and paid tiers to:
    * Choose from 1,000+ rules written by the community and [r2c](https://r2c.dev) to find security, correctness, and performance bugs.
    * Deploy Semgrep in CI with the click of a button
    * Centrally manage policies across all your projects
    * See results where you want them
    * Measure the efficacy of code policies
    * Save, share, and run custom rules

### History

Semgrep is an evolution of [pfff](https://github.com/returntocorp/pfff/), which began at [Facebook](https://github.com/facebookarchive/pfff) in 2009, which itself was an evolution of the Linux refactoring tool [Coccinelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccinelle_(software)). [r2c](https://r2c.dev/team) revitalized the project after its original author, [Yoann Padioleau](https://github.com/aryx), joined the company.

# Language support

Some supported languages are in alpha or beta; a data-driven approach that evaluates the parse rate of the language on a wide corpus determines when to promote a language to general availability (GA). For more details, see [the breakdown of all supported languages](status.md).
