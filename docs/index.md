<h3>May 2025 release notes summary</h3>
<!-- 5-7 bullets across the product suite -->

- **Java and Kotlin**: Projects can now be scanned without lockfiles through Semgrep Managed Scans.
- Assistant Memories v2 is now in **public beta**:
  - Managing memories in Semgrep AppSec Platform now occurs under **Rules & Policies**, not **Settings**.
  - Semgrep AppSec Platform displays data on the scope and impact of memories, including the number of findings affected and which findings affected
  - Assistant now provides **suggested memories**, which are those that Assistant has generated based on your past triage actions. You can view these memories at any time in Semgrep AppSec Platform by navigating to **Rules & Policies > Assistant Memories > Suggested**. For each suggestion, you can choose one of the following actions:
    - Activate the suggested memory to inform Assistant's future advice.
    - Edit the memory, then activate it.
    - Delete the memory.
- Improved the Supply Chain UX in various pages:
    - If the finding has a function call that proves the finding is reachable, this function call is highlighted in the code in the finding's **Details** page.
    - Added context in PR comments as to **why** a finding is reachable, under the section **Why this is reachable**. This alerts developers to the impact of a reachable finding. 
    - Improved how filters are presented in the **Supply Chain > Vulnerabilities** page.
    - Unreachable findings are hidden by default from the findings list.
- Improved performance of Semgrep Secret scans due to back-end updates.
