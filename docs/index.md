Semgrep is an AppSec suite for finding bugs, detecting dependency vulnerabilities, and enforcing code standards. Its rules look like the code you already write -- no abstract syntax trees, regex wrestling, or painful DSLs.

The following code editor shows a rule for finding Python `print()` statements. Run it by clicking the [‚ñ∏] button:

The Semgrep ecosystem includes:

- [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login) - Deploy, manage, and monitor Code, Supply Chain, and Secrets at scale. Semgrep integrates with continuous integration (CI) providers such as GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI, and more.
- [Semgrep Code](/semgrep-code/overview) - Scan your code with Semgrep to find OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and protect against critical security risks specific to your organization.
- [Semgrep Secrets](/semgrep-secrets/conceptual-overview) - Detect and validate leaked credentials in your codebase.
- [Semgrep Supply Chain (SSC)](/semgrep-supply-chain/overview) - A high-signal dependency scanner to reachable vulnerabilities in open source third-party libraries and functions.

Semgrep AppSec Platform, Code, and Supply Chain are **free** for up to 10 contributors. [Get started ‚Üí](/getting-started/quickstart)
