# Visual Studio Code and Semgrep on Windows
Semgrep has developed an [extension](https://semgrep.dev/docs/extensions/semgrep-vs-code/) to be used in Visual Studio Code. 
The extension can be used in Visual Studio Code installed on Windows, but you'll need to install WSL and add Semgrep to it.
Follow these steps to set up WSL, Semgrep, and the VS Code extension:

1. Install WSL. 
2. Install [Semgrep on WSL as Python package.](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/#installing-and-running-semgrep-locally)
3. Run `semgrep login` to get the login URL for the Semgrep Cloud Platform. Open the login URL in the browser and login.
4. Install WSL extension for Visual Studio Code. Check [these steps.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl)
5. Install Semgrep extension for Visual Studio Code. Check [how to install an extension.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-an-extension)
6. Open the project in VS Code

Click the Semgrep icon to scan your project (see image below).
