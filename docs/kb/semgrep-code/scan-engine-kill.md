# Troubleshooting "You are seeing this because the engine was killed" on monorepos

Scans can fail to complete on large monorepos. This article describes possible solutions, such as:

- Scanning the components of the monorepos separately.
- Serializing the type of scan performed.
- Increasing the RAM of the job runner for CI jobs.

Given the following log or similar:

```
[ERROR] Error while running rules:
          You are seeing this because the engine was killed.

          The most common reason this happens is because it used too much memory.
          If your repo is large (~10k files or more), you have three options:
          1. Increase the amount of memory available to semgrep
          2. Reduce the number of jobs semgrep runs with via `-j <jobs>`.  We
            recommend using 1 job if you are running out of memory.
          3. Scan the repo in parts (contact us for help)

          Otherwise, it is likely that semgrep is hitting the limit on only some
          files. In this case, you can try to set the limit on the amount of memory
          semgrep can use on each file with `--max-memory <memory>`. We recommend
          lowering this to a limit 70% of the available memory. For CI runs with
          interfile analysis, the default max-memory is 5000MB. Without, the default
          is unlimited.

          The last thing you can try if none of these work is to raise the stack
          limit with `ulimit -s <limit>`.

          If you have tried all these steps and still are seeing this error, please
          contact us.

           Error: semgrep-core exited with unexpected output
```

## Determining the size of your monorepo

By default, Semgrep places resource limitations on the size of file scanned and memory allocated.

However, Semgrep does not place limitations on the number of files scanned and scanning a large monorepo can involve thousands of lines of code. Thus, the first course of action is to determine exactly how many files are getting scanned:

1. View your CI logs. This step depends on your CI provider.
2. Search for the section **Scan Status**.

A monorepo's components can look like this:

```console
┌─────────────┐
│ Scan Status │ 
└─────────────┘ 
  Scanning 91749 files tracked by git with 1068 Code rules, 498 Pro rules:
            
  Language      Rules    Files          Origin      Rules

  yaml              7     1952

  terraform        13      470      
  bash              4      408           
  go               95      228
  ruby             22      228
  php              25       99
  swift            41       89
  html              1       72         
  dockerfile        2       31           
  c                 9       16
  rust             49        8
  java            156        2
  kotlin           47        1
```

Now you have a good idea of the size of your monorepo. After establishing the size and breakdown of programming languages and files, you can decide what adjustments to take for a scan to succeed.

## Scanning components separately 

Based on the composition provided by the logs, you may be able to determine if your repository is modular. If so, you can try scanning the components separately.

[<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Interfile analysis](/docs/semgrep-code/semgrep-pro-engine-intro/#types-of-semgrep-pro-engine-analysis) still applies in the smaller scope assuming the modules are disparate. 

### Scanning schedule

You can perform modular scans on a daily basis and then perform one big monolithic scan every two weeks or so to keep close tabs and cap any false negative interfile or inter-component outliers that can get introduced with code change as a way of truing up your dependency graph for the monolithic build. This helps deflect costs as you are scanning the majority on smaller runners or Kubernetes clusters.  

However, you still need to scan the whole monolithic build, whether you scan it biweekly or daily, and the following sections apply to tackling that monolith whether you adopt the modular paradigm of scanning or not. 

## Serializing types of scans

With Semgrep 1.42.0 and later, Secret rulesets are now included in the default scan configuration.  Instead of scanning Code, Supply Chain and Secret rulesets concurrently, you can circumnavigate resource limits by running different types of scans in a serial fashion.  Rather than issuing one monolithic command, for example:

```console
 semgrep ci
```
 
You can instead run:
 
 ```
semgrep ci --code --pro
semgrep ci --supply-chain --oss-only
semgrep ci --secrets
 ```

As a result, less memory is used in total at any point in time.

## Increasing RAM 

Lastly, you can also tackle a large scan by increasing the RAM.

### Establish RAM baseline and avoid swap memory

First, establish how much memory is required to scan. Determining the total amount of memory required is key, not just to avoid killed scans but to run scans that use swap memory. Avoid swap memory when scanning with any static analysis tool. Semgrep and other SAST tools are disk I/O intensive and swapping in and out with a swap file reduces performance severely.

- In the early phases of your scan deployment, start with a relatively larger runner or Kubernetes pod that has lots of memory.
- Perform the scan with the `-j 1` option. This sets the number of jobs to 1 (no parallelization of subprocesses).
- Enable a swap monitor for the entire duration of the scan to ensure an accurate assessment of RAM used, for example, running a script that samples the memory frequently: 
```
$ free -m 
```
to see both your RAM and your swap space usage in Linux. 
- Then perhaps add 10% more RAM to your final memory tally to account for churn, increase in code, and so on.  This is something you must gauge.

## Parallelization

Once you have determined the RAM sufficient to scan your large codebase, you can now introduce parallelization to speed up the subproccesses that can be parallelized. Larger Kubernetes pod and runners charge on a time basis, so it now becomes a study of feasiblity to achieve the optimal configuration.  

You can start with a large Kubernetes pod but still only run with one job with `-j 1` set so that you can determine what the total memory is required for this kind of job. Then, you can pare this memory usage somewhat, such as by specifying `-j 2`, all the whilst still monitoring for any swap usage.

If that succeeds, you can experiment with a `-j 4` configuration and continue decreasing the scan time in nearly half and so on.  Since Kubernetes pods are charging per-minute, it serves you well to determine the optimal configuration in bumping up the number of parallel jobs to speed up the scan.  Thus, there is a balancing act between achieving full scan coverage and keeping your overhead costs down as much as possible.  

You can expect to see more total RAM than `-j 1` but not exactly half per thread. Codebases are highly variant; it's difficult to benchmark `N number of lines per MB`. But there is overhead in parallelization, so you would not get a true halving of RAM required going from 1 to 2 jobs. In fact, the total RAM required is likely to be greater for a `-j 2` job than a `-j 1` job, but you should see a decrease in total time.  This is why the empirical testing is important, to find where the right balance is in total time spent versus cost.
