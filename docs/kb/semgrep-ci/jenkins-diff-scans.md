# Full and diff-aware scans with GitHub and Jenkins

This guide provides two setup options: one for full Semgrep scans only, and one for full and diff-aware Semgrep scans. Full scans use a simple Pipeline project, while combining full and diff-aware scans uses a Multibranch Pipeline project. Both options use GitHub as the source code manager, with a repository whose default branch is `main`.

Your UI (user interface) may vary depending on your Jenkins installation. These steps use a Classic UI Jenkins interface.

## Full scans

### Create your Jenkinsfile

To start the process, create your initial `Jenkinsfile` in the root of the repository where you're setting up Semgrep. This code snippet uses Jenkins declarative syntax and runs Semgrep in Docker.

```bash
pipeline {
  agent any
  environment {
    // Required for a Semgrep AppSec Platform-connected scan:
    SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN = credentials('SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN')
  }
  stages {
    stage('semgrep-scan') {
      steps {
        sh '''docker pull semgrep/semgrep && \
            docker run \
            -e SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=$SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN \
            -v "$(pwd):$(pwd)" --workdir $(pwd) \
            semgrep/semgrep semgrep ci '''
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This Jenkinsfile uses a `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN` stored in the Jenkins instance credentials store. It does not set any other variables.

### Set up a pipeline

#### Under General

1. Check the box "GitHub Project" and enter the URL for the project, `https://github.com/<namespace>/<project>/`
2. Under Build Triggers, select the "GitHub Hook trigger for GITScm polling" box.

#### Under Pipeline

1. Definition: Pipeline script from SCM
2. SCM: Git
3. Repositories:
    - Repository URL: `https://github.com/<namespace>/<project>/`
    - Credentials: (select the appropriate credentials for your project)
4. Branches to build: `refs/heads/main`
5. Additional Behaviours: from the dropdown, select "Check out to specific local branch"
    - Enter `**` for Branch name.
6. Script Path: Jenkinsfile
7. Check box: Lightweight checkout

#### On GitHub

If your Jenkins instance is configured to manage webhooks automatically on GitHub, these steps are not necessary. To review the settings and view the webhook URL, go to **Manage Jenkins > Configure System > GitHub**. Expand the <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i> next to **GitHub Server** to find the webhook URL, and review the configuration to see if hooks are managed automatically.

1. Visit `https://github.com/<namespace>/<project>/settings/hooks`.
2. Click **Add Webhook**.
3. Under **Payload URL**, enter your Jenkins' instance webhook URL. Generally this is in the form `$JENKINS_BASE_URL/github-webhook/`.
4. Select `application/json` for Content-Type.
5. Select **Send me everything**.

With configuration provided previously, findings in Semgrep AppSec Platform appear under the Jenkins project name, rather than under the typical GitHub name `<namespace>/<project>`. To change the name using `SEMGREP_REPO_NAME`, use this Jenkinsfile instead:

```bash
pipeline {
  agent any
  environment {
    // Required for a Semgrep AppSec Platform-connected scan:
    SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN = credentials('SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN')
		// Set typical project (repo) name
    SEMGREP_REPO_NAME = env.GIT_URL.replaceFirst(/^https:\/\/github.com\/(.*)$/, '$1')
  }
  stages {
    stage('semgrep-scan') {
      steps {
        sh '''docker pull semgrep/semgrep && \
            docker run \
            -e SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=$SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN \
            -e SEMGREP_REPO_NAME=$SEMGREP_REPO_NAME \
            -v "$(pwd):$(pwd)" --workdir $(pwd) \
            semgrep/semgrep semgrep ci '''
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding diff-aware scans

Semgrep diff-aware scans can be set up in several different ways using Jenkins. This example sets up a Multibranch Pipeline using `when` conditions in the Jenkinsfile, using a full scan configuration based on the example in the preceding section.

The intent of the configuration is to run full scans on the default branch and diff-aware scans on PR branches. Using a Multibranch pipeline provides access to useful variables for the configuration.

### Create the Jenkinsfile

Add the following to a Jenkinsfile in the root of the repository. This code snippet uses Jenkins declarative syntax and runs Semgrep in Docker.

```bash
pipeline {
  agent any
  environment {
    // Required for a Semgrep Cloud Platform-connected scan:
    SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN = credentials('SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN')
    // Set repo name to expected format
    SEMGREP_REPO_NAME = env.GIT_URL.replaceFirst(/^https:\/\/github.com\/(.*)$/, '$1')
  }
  stages {
    stage('semgrep-diff-scan') {
      when {
        branch "PR-*"
      }
      steps {
        sh '''git fetch --no-tags --force --progress -- $GIT_URL +refs/heads/$CHANGE_TARGET:refs/remotes/origin/$CHANGE_TARGET
              git checkout -b $CHANGE_TARGET origin/$CHANGE_TARGET
              git checkout $GIT_BRANCH
           '''
        sh '''docker pull semgrep/semgrep && \
            docker run \
            -e SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=$SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN \
            -e SEMGREP_REPO_NAME=$SEMGREP_REPO_NAME \
            -e SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF=$(git merge-base $GIT_BRANCH $CHANGE_TARGET) \
            -e SEMGREP_PR_ID = "${env.CHANGE_ID}"
            -v "$(pwd):$(pwd)" --workdir $(pwd) \
            semgrep/semgrep semgrep ci '''
      }
    }
    stage('semgrep-scan') {
      when {
        branch "main"
      }
      steps {
        sh '''docker pull semgrep/semgrep && \
            docker run \
            -e SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=$SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN \
            -e SEMGREP_REPO_NAME=$SEMGREP_REPO_NAME \
            -v "$(pwd):$(pwd)" --workdir $(pwd) \
            semgrep/semgrep semgrep ci '''
      }
    }
  }
  post {
    // Clean after build
    always {
      cleanWs()
    }
  }
}
```

The Jenkinsfile defines two Semgrep stages, each of which is run for certain branches: a diff-aware scan for PR branches, and a full scan for the main branch. This diff-aware scan configuration uses a computed merge base, rather than setting the merge base to the default branch. This is more similar to how Semgrep performs in GitHub actions. Setting the SEMGREP_REPO_NAME and SEMGREP_PR_ID allows Semgrep to identify the connected project and related PR.

In order to compute the merge-base, the pipeline performs some additional git commands to make the default branch available to git for computation, and cleans the workspace afterwards so those commands can always run successfully in a clean workspace.

:::info
Using a computed merge base is strongly recommended. If you instead set `SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF` to `main` or `master`, you may see spurious findings in diff-aware scans if the remote branch has been updated independently of the PR branch, or the branch may not be available locally unless you perform a `git fetch` or `git checkout` as shown in this example.

### Configure the Multibranch pipeline

- Branch Sources: GitHub
    - Credentials: (select the appropriate credentials for your project)
    - Repository HTTPS URL: `https://github.com/<namespace>/<project>`
- Behaviors:
    - Discover branches
        - Strategy: exclude branches that are also filed as PRs
    - Discover pull requests from origin
        - The current pull request revision
    - Check out to matching local branch
    - Property strategy: all branches get the same properties
- Build Configuration: by Jenkinsfile
- Scan Repository Triggers: periodically if not otherwise run, 30 min (interval configurable)
- Optional: Discard old items (7 days/7 items), so that you don’t lose logs for deleted branches immediately

If you haven’t already, follow the [On GitHub](#on-github) instructions to configure a webhook to notify Jenkins about PR events.
