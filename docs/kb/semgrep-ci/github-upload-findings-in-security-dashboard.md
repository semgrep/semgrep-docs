# Why aren't findings populating in the GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard after running Semgrep in CI?

When scanning with Semgrep in CI, findings automatically populate in Semgrep Cloud Platform. To show findings in the GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard, run an alternate job that uploads findings to the dashboard in the form of a `SARIF` file. See [Sample GitHub Actions configuration file](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#sample-github-actions-configuration-file) for an example.

If you run the alternate job and it fails with a "resource not accessible by integration" error, there are two possible causes.

## The workflow or job does not have sufficient permissions

Semgrep findings in a private repository can only populate in the GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard if the correct permissions are set using the `permissions` key. See an example below.

## The workflow permissions in your repository's Actions settings are set to read-only

Workflow permissions are set to `read-only` (default) unless they've previously been changed. The job requires `write` permissions to be successful.

To change permissions:
1. Navigate to your organization or repository in GitHub.
2. Click **Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions**.

Target permissions

:::info 
Changing the repository's default workflow permissions changes the permissions for all workflows in that repository. For more granular permissions, set the `permissions` key at the workflow or job level in the `semgrep.yml` workflow file. Learn more about the `permissions` key at [Assigning permissions to jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs#setting-the-github_token-permissions-for-all-jobs-in-a-workflow), or review the example workflow-level permissions below.

### Example job configuration with `permissions` key

This job only requires `write` permissions for `security-events`.

```yml
# Name of this GitHub Actions workflow.
name: Semgrep

on:
  # Scan changed files in PRs (diff-aware scanning):
  pull_request: {}
  # Scan on-demand through GitHub Actions interface:
  workflow_dispatch: {}
  # Scan mainline branches and report all findings:
  push:
    branches: ["master", "main"]
  # Schedule the CI job (this method uses cron syntax):
  schedule:
    - cron: '20 17 * * *' # Sets Semgrep to scan every day at 17:20 UTC.
    # It is recommended to change the schedule to a random time.

jobs:
  semgrep:
    # User definable name of this GitHub Actions job.
    name: semgrep/ci 
    # If you are self-hosting, change the following `runs-on` value: 
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    container:
      # A Docker image with Semgrep installed. Do not change this.
      image: returntocorp/semgrep

    # Skip any PR created by dependabot to avoid permission issues:
    if: (github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]')
    permissions:
      # required for all workflows
      security-events: write
      # for workflows in private repos
      actions: read
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: semgrep scan --sarif > semgrep.sarif
      - name: Upload SARIF file for GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: semgrep.sarif
        if: always()
```
