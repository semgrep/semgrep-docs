# How to trigger diff-aware scans

When working with a CI provider, you can set Semgrep to run **[diff-aware scans](/deployment/customize-ci-jobs#set-up-diff-aware-scans)** as well as full scans. Diff-aware scans run on your code before and after some baseline, and only report findings newly introduced in the commits after that baseline.

To add this configuration in Azure Pipelines, follow the general instructions provided in [Sample CI configurations: Azure Pipelines](/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs#azure-pipelines). If your repository's default branch is not `main`, change the references to `main` to the name of your default branch.

```yaml
steps:
- checkout: self
  clean: true
  fetchDepth: 20
persistCredentials: true
- script: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install semgrep
    if [ $(System.PullRequest.PullRequestId) -ge 0 ]; then
      echo "Pull Request Scan from branch: $(Build.SourceBranchName)"
      git fetch origin main:origin/main
      export SEMGREP_PR_ID=$(System.PullRequest.PullRequestId)
      export SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF='origin/main'
      semgrep ci
```

If you are running both full and diff-aware scans for the repository, you can use if clauses or define separate templates for full scans and [diff-aware scans](/deployment/customize-ci-jobs#set-up-diff-aware-scans) in Azure Pipelines. Diff-aware scans require the use of the  `SEMGREP_PR_ID` and `SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF` variables, while full scans do not. Full scans are typically run on the condition `if [ $(Build.SourceBranchName) = "main" ]`.

<TabItem value='bitbucket'>

In the Bitbucket Pipelines configuration file, set [`SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF`](/semgrep-ci/ci-environment-variables#semgrep_baseline_ref) to enable diff-aware scanning:

```yaml
image: semgrep/semgrep:latest

pipelines:
  ...
  pull-requests:
    '**':
      - step:
        name: Semgrep scan on PR
        script:
          - export SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=$SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN
          - export BITBUCKET_TOKEN=$PAT # Necessary for PR comments
          # Change to your default branch if different from main
          - export SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF="origin/main"
          - git fetch origin "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"
          - semgrep ci
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='github'>

Include the following definition in your GitHub Actions configuration file to enable diff-aware scanning:

```yaml
on:
  # Scan changed files in PRs (diff-aware scanning):
  pull_request: {}
```

### Example

```yaml
# Name of this GitHub Actions workflow.
name: Semgrep

on:
  # Scan changed files in PRs (diff-aware scanning):
  pull_request: {}

jobs:
  semgrep:
    # User definable name of this GitHub Actions job.
    name: semgrep/ci
    # If you are self-hosting, change the following `runs-on` value:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    container:
      # A Docker image with Semgrep installed. Do not change this.
      image: semgrep/semgrep

    # Skip any PR created by dependabot to avoid permission issues:
    if: (github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]')

    steps:
      # Fetch project source with GitHub Actions Checkout. Use either v3 or v4.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # Run the "semgrep ci" command on the command line of the docker image.
      - run: semgrep ci
        env:
          # Connect to Semgrep AppSec Platform through your SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN.
          # Generate a token from Semgrep AppSec Platform > Settings
          # and add it to your GitHub secrets.
          SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN }}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='gitlab'>

Set up your `.gitlab-ci.yml` conditions (usually `rules`) to run a scan if `$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID` is defined. Semgrep automatically runs a diff-aware scan if the variable is present, as it is in merge request pipelines:

```yaml
rules:
  # Scan changed files in MRs, (diff-aware scanning):
  - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID
```
### Example

```yaml
semgrep:
  # A Docker image with Semgrep installed.
  image: semgrep/semgrep
  # Run the "semgrep ci" command on the command line of the docker image.
  script: semgrep ci

  rules:
    # Scan changed files in MRs, (diff-aware scanning):
    - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID

  variables:
    # Connect to Semgrep AppSec Platform through your SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN.
    # Generate a token from Semgrep AppSec Platform > Settings
    # and add it as a variable in your GitLab CI/CD project settings.
    SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN: $SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN
```

<TabItem value='jenkins'>

Jenkins is highly configurable and there are multiple approaches to setting up diff-aware scans.

See the following articles for detailed guides:

* [Set up Jenkins pipeline projects for Bitbucket repositories](/docs/kb/semgrep-ci/bitbuket-jenkins-pipeline-projects)
* [Full and diff-aware scans with GitHub and Jenkins](/docs/kb/semgrep-ci/jenkins-diff-scans)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='other'>

Set [`SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF`](/semgrep-ci/ci-environment-variables#semgrep_baseline_ref) to enable diff-aware scanning:

```console
export SEMGREP_BASELINE_REF="main"
```

You may need to perform additional `git checkout` steps to ensure that the configured baseline ref is available in the scan environment along with the source branch.
