# Triggering events from Bitbucket to Jenkins


This guide walks you through connecting your Bitbucket source code manager (SCM) with Jenkins, a CI/CD environment, through the use of **webhooks**. By connecting Bitbucket with Jenkins, you are able to customize jobs, such as your Semgrep job, based on push or pull events from Bitbucket.

## Defining a Bitbucket webhook 
One way to connect Bitbucket (Cloud or Server) to a Jenkins instance is defining a Bitbucket webhook.
It allows you to trigger builds on Bitbucket's push and pull requests events.

:::info Prerequisites
* You must install the [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Bitbucket Push and Pull Request](https://plugins.jenkins.io/bitbucket-push-and-pull-request/) plugin on your the Jenkins server. This method requires that your Jenkins instance is compatible with this plugin.

The steps to set up the webhook are the following:

1. From your Bitbucket repository click on **Repository Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook**

1. Enter a **Title** for your webhook.
1. Specify the URL. It must follow the pattern: `https://<YOUR_JENKINS_SERVER>/bitbucket-hook/`
1. Select the following **Triggers:** 
    1. In the **Repository** section, select **Push**.
    1. In the **Pull request** section, select **Created** and **Updated**.

Now the webhook is set on the Bitbucket side. You can use it from your Jenkins instance.
