# How to exclude certain file types for a particular rule

Certain filetypes can generate numerous false positives and hold up your triage process. This document helps you achieve a selective middle ground:
* Continue to include the file type to scan with other rules
* Reduce copious amounts of time triaging false positives

## Background

This article uses a real-life case scenario in scanning `.svg` files as a platform to explain this solution. `svg` files mostly comprise a string of thousands of characters:

```
<image id="image0" width="2896" height="998" xlink:href="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAC1AAA**AP**mCAYAAABQS58cAAABR2lDQ1BJQ0MgUHJvZmlsZQAAKJFjYGASSSwoyGFhYGDIzSspCnJ3UoiIjFJgf8LAzsDIwM1gwqCRmFxc4BgQ4ANUwgCjUcG3a0C1QHBZF2SW3AzZBT+7Sn68UphgqTU7fyemehTAlZJanAyk/wBxWnJBUQkDA2MKkK1cXlIAYncA2SJFQEcB2XNA7HQIewOInQRhHwGrCQlyBrJvANkCyRmJQDMYXwDZOklI4ulIbKi9IMDj4urjoxBqZG5oEUjAuaSDktSKEhDtnF9QWZSZnlGi4AgMpVQFz7xkPR0FIwMjAwYGUJhDVH8OAoclo9g+hFj+EgYGi28MDMwTEWJJUxgYtrcxMEjcQ…..
```

Semgrep’s standard artifactory rule, for example, reports on:

```
_\# ruleid: detected-artifactory-password_

_AP6xxxxxxxxxx_

_\# ruleid: detected-artifactory-password_

_AP2xxxxxxxxxx_

...
```

Because `.svg` files are made up of thousands of characters, the match (in bold) in the `.svg` snippet creates a false positive finding due to the artifactory rule. It is a false positive because no passwords are leaked by the `.svg` file.


## Choosing the appropriate ignoring solution


Semgrep offers many different ways of muting false positives: 

* **Adding `nosemgrep` as a comment on the first line of code in the file.** This would require having to keep track of each new file for this target `.svg` file type and editing each file accordingly, creating a layer of maintenance.

* **Ignore the file entirely, by adding it to a .semgrepignore file.** but that would exclude the file from being scanned with all rules, not just the artifactory rule.


## Achieving a happy medium



You can safely assume `.svg` files do not intentionally contain artifactory passwords, so you can exclude scanning against this file type. The following procedure demonstrates how to:

* Create a customized version of the rule that is generating the false positives that excludes the target file type:  


a) Download the flaring rule in question from the registry.  For demonstration purposes, we will specify the artifactory rule.    

b) Modify the rule ID to something custom:

  \- id: my_detected-artifactory-password

c) Exclude the target filetype in question from the rule as per:

https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/rule-syntax/#paths

So, the modified rule reflects an update as such:


 % cat my_custom_artifactory.yml 
 
rules:

  \- id: my_detected-artifactory-password
  
    options:
    
    .
    .
    .
    
    - metavariable-analysis:
        analyzer: entropy
        metavariable: $ITEM 
    paths:
    
       exclude:
          - "*.svg" 
   languages:
       - generic
    .
    .
    .

* Alter the scan command to still scan for the default configuration you have (just using --config=auto as my example) but:

 a) Exclude the original noisy rule as articulated in the false positive reporting (long-hand form) 

 b) Include the new custom rule (above) that excludes your target paths.   

Thus, your original semgrep scan command (or semgrep ci command) now looks like: 


% semgrep scan --config=auto --config=my_custom_artifactory.yml __--exclude-rule generic.secrets.security.detected-artifactory-password.detected-artifactory-password__

You are including the custom rule which excludes scanning against specified paths/file types, so in this case, the .svg files are excluded.   but still scanning against all other remaining rules against all file types, including .svg files.
