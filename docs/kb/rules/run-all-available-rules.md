# Running all available rules on a repository

To run all rules that are available within the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) without using the Rule board, enter the following command:

```
semgrep --config=r/all
```

This command runs the following rules from the Semgrep Registry:

* All public or community-written rules
* Your organization's private rules, if you are logged in 
* Semgrep Pro rules, if you have access to them

Refer to the following snippet for a sample output of `config=r/all` while logged in through `semgrep ci`:

If you are not logged in, `config=r/all` runs public rules only.

## Troubleshooting invalid configuration file

The following error may occur:

```
[ERROR] invalid configuration file found (1 configs were invalid)
```

This error appears if there is a syntax or other error within any of your custom rules.

Enter the following commands as a workaround:

```
semgrep --config r/all . -d
semgrep --config ~/.semgrep/semgrep_rules.json .
```

The first command creates a cache of rules and creates a `semgrep_rules.json`. The second command then runs the rules.
