# How does Semgrep assign severity levels to rules?

## Semgrep Code

Semgrep Code rules have one of three severity levels: `ERROR` (High), `WARNING` (Medium), or `INFO` (Low). The severity indicates how critical the issues are that a rule potentially detects.

The rule author assigns the rule severity. For custom and third-party rules, their severity assignment is the source of truth.

As a best practice, severity for Semgrep Registry rules in the `security` category should be assigned by evaluating the combination of [likelihood](/docs/contributing/contributing-to-semgrep-rules-repository/#likelihood) and [impact](/docs/contributing/contributing-to-semgrep-rules-repository/#impact). 

## Semgrep Supply Chain 

Semgrep Supply Chain rules have one of four severity levels: Critical, High, Medium or Low. The score assigned to the CVE using the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score])(https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss), or the severity value set by the GitHub Advisory Database, determines the severity in Semgrep Supply Chain. For example, if a vulnerability is given a CVSS score of 9.0 or higher it is assigned Critical.
