# My rule with `pattern-not` doesn't work: using pattern-not-inside

One common issue when writing custom rules is that an attempt to exclude some cases using `pattern-not` is unsuccessful. Often, the solution is to switch from `pattern-not` to `pattern-not-inside`.

## What does "inside" mean?

Intuitively, "inside" means "wholly within an outer container". But in Semgrep, one pattern being "inside" another can also mean that it is at the same level, but includes less code. 

Another way to express this is that `pattern-not` assumes that the matches are the same "size" and produces undesirable results if thatâ€™s not the case.

## Example

For example, the `find-unverified-transactions` [custom rule example](https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/rule-ideas/#systematize-project-specific-coding-patterns) uses `pattern` and `pattern-not`, and matches the target code successfully:

However, this rule has some redundancy. Both pattern clauses contain:

```yml
public $RETURN $METHOD(...){
  ...
}
```

But pulling this container out as a `pattern-inside` and rewriting the rule as: 

```yml
rules:
  - id: find-unverified-transactions-inside
    patterns:
      - pattern-inside: |
          $RETURN $METHOD(...) {
            ...
          }
      - pattern: |
          ...
          make_transaction($T);
          ...
      - pattern-not: |
          ...
          verify_transaction($T);
          ...
          make_transaction($T);
          ...       
    message: >
      In $METHOD, there's a call to make_transaction() without first calling
      verify_transaction() on the Transaction object.
    severity: WARNING
    languages:
      - java
```

is not successful - [try it out](https://semgrep.dev/playground/s/KZOd?editorMode=advanced) if you like!

With our knowledge about how `pattern-not` operates, we can see that this is because the matches are not the same size. The `pattern-not` is larger, but at the same level. With that, we can determine that the last clause should be `pattern-not-inside`:

```yml
- pattern-not-inside: |
    ...
    verify_transaction($T);
    ...
    make_transaction($T);
    ...       
```

With that change, the rule successfully matches the example code.
