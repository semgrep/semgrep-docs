# Search for specific findings by rule or CVE

Semgrep offers a range of filters that allow you to narrow down your search for specific findings. In some cases, you may want to search by rule ID for Semgrep Code findings or CVE for Supply Chain findings.

This guide walks you through finding the specific rule ID in Semgrep, then applying it as a filter. You can then combine this filter with other filters, such as **Projects** or **Status**.

This method can be used for Semgrep Code and Supply Chain.

## Retrieve the Rule ID

1. Sign in to [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
1. Navigate to either the **Code** or **Supply Chain** page depending on which type of finding you're looking for.
    1. For Semgrep Code findings, the Rule ID is the heading of each group of findings. Copy this value.

    1. For Semgrep Supply Chain findings, the **CVE** or **MAL** ID is shown on the upper-right heading of each group of findings. Copy this value. Add a dash between the prefix, such as MAL or CVE, and the numerical value.

1. Enter the value you copied in the **Rule** filter for Semgrep Code or **Rules** filter for Semgrep Supply Chain. This narrows down the findings to that specific rule or CVE.
1. You can continue adding values to the rules filter. The rules filter includes findings from **any** of the values indicated.

From there, you can apply any other filters as necessary.
