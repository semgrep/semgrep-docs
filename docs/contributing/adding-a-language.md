# How to add support for a new language

import PL from '@site/src/components/Placeholder';

This document is about adding support for a new programming language in Semgrep using the [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) technology. Most languages in semgrep use `tree-parser` though you may also need to update the `menhir` parser.

Repositories involved directly:

* [<code><strong><i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> semgrep</strong></code>](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep): the semgrep command line program.
* [<code><strong><i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep</strong></code>](https://github.com/semgrep/ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep): language-specific setup, generates C/OCaml parsers for semgrep.
* A new repository <code><strong>semgrep-<PL>LANG</PL></strong></code> for the language you're adding: this is a C or OCaml parser generated from `ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep` by a Semgrep administrator.
* [<code><strong><i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> semgrep-interfaces</strong></code>](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-interfaces/blob/main/generate.py)

## Placeholder values

This document uses the placeholder <PL>LANG</PL> to indicate that you should substitute the name of your language as the value in the given context. For example, if your language is Ruby, and the document's instructions read:

> Create a new file <code>TEST_LANG_<PL>LANG</PL>.txt</code> where <PL>LANG</PL> is in small caps.

The name of your file should be `TEST_LANG_ruby.txt`

> Create a file <code>Pretty_print.**_EXTENSION_**</code> with the filename extension of your language:

The name of your file should be `Pretty_print.rb`.

`semgrep` repository overview
--

There are some GitHub repositories involved in porting a language.
Here is the file hierarchy of the [`semgrep`
repository](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep):

```
/languages
â”œâ”€â”€ bash
    ...
â”œâ”€â”€ swift
    â”œâ”€â”€ generic
    â””â”€â”€ tree-sitter
        â””â”€â”€ semgrep-swift # generated tree-sitter parsers
```

When you're done with the work in [`ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep`](https://github.com/semgrep/ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep), you'll need a new repository <strong><code>semgrep-<PL>LANG</PL></code></strong> to host the generated parser code.

Ask someone from the Semgrep team to create one for you. For this, they should use the template
[`semgrep-lang-template`](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-lang-template) when creating the repository.

The instructions for adding a language start in [`ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep`](https://github.com/semgrep/ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep), as indicated below. Be careful that you are always in the correct repository!

Set up `ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep`
--

As a model, you can use the existing setup for `ruby` or `javascript`. The most complicated setup is for `typescript` and `tsx`.

### Expedited setup

If you're lucky, the language you want to add can be added with the script `add-simple-lang`:

```
cd lang
./add-simple-lang --help
```

Follow the instructions from --help.

This often works with languages that define a single dialect using a `grammar.js` file at the root of the project. If this simplified approach fails, use the [Manual setup](#manual-setup) instructions below to understand what's going on or to set things up manually.

### Manual setup

From the `ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep` repository, do the following:

1. Create a <code>lang/<PL>LANG</PL></code> folder.
2. Make a `test/ok` directory. Inside the directory, create a simple `hello-world` program for the language you are porting. Name the program <code>hello-world.<PL>EXTENSION</PL></code>.
3. Now make a file called `extensions.txt` and input all the language extensions (.rb, .kt, etc) for your language in the file.
4. Create a file called `fyi.list` with all the information files, such as
    <code>semgrep-grammars/src/tree-sitter-<PL>LANG</PL>/LICENSE</code>,
    <code>semgrep-grammars/src/tree-sitter-<PL>LANG/grammar.js</PL></code>,
    <code>semgrep-grammars/src/semgrep-<PL>LANG</PL>/grammar.js</code>, etc.
   to bundle with the final OCaml/C project.
5. Link the Makefile.common to a Makefile in the directory with:
   `ln -s ../Makefile.common Makefile`
6. Create a test corpus. You can do this by:
   * Running `most-starred-for-language` to gather projects
     on which to run parsing stats. Run with the following command:
     <code>./scripts/most-starred-for-language <PL>LANG</PL> <PL>YOUR_USERNAME</PL> <PL>API_KEY</PL></code>
   * Using github advanced search to find the most starred or most forked repositories.
7. Copy the generated `projects.txt` file into the <code>lang/<PL>LANG</PL></code> directory.
8. Add in extra projects and extra input sets as you see necessary.

Here's the file hierarchy for Ruby:

```shell
lang/ruby               # language name of the form [a-z][a-z0-9]*
â”œâ”€â”€ extensions.txt      # standard name. Required for stats.
â”œâ”€â”€ fyi.list            # list of informational files to copy. Recommended.
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile -> ../Makefile.common
â”œâ”€â”€ projects.txt        # standard name. Required for stats.
â””â”€â”€ test                # sample input files
    â”œâ”€â”€ ok              # contains input files supported by the current grammar
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ comment.rb
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ex1.rb
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ex2.rb
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hello.rb
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ poly.rb
    â””â”€â”€ xfail            # contains input files that are expected to fail
        â””â”€â”€ rating.rb
```

To test a language in `ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep`, you must build the
`ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep` OCaml code generator, run it to produce a parser,
then run some tests for the parser. Full instructions for this
are given in [updating-a-grammar](updating-a-grammar.md) under
"Testing". The short instructions are:
1. For the first time, build everything with `./scripts/rebuild-everything`.
2. Subsequently, work from the <code>lang/<PL>LANG</PL></code> folder and run
   `make` and `make test`.

### The `fyi.list` file

The `fyi.list` file was created to specify informational files that
should accompany the generated files. These files are typically:

* the source grammar, most often a single `grammar.js` file.
* the licensing conditions usually specified in a `LICENSE` file.

Example:

```
# Comments are allowed on their own line.
# Blank lines are ok.

# Each path is relative to ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep/lang
semgrep-grammars/src/tree-sitter-ruby/LICENSE
semgrep-grammars/src/tree-sitter-ruby/grammar.js
semgrep-grammars/src/semgrep-ruby/grammar.js
```

The files listed in `fyi.list` end up in a `fyi` folder in
tree-sitter-lang. For example,
[see `ruby/fyi`](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-ruby/tree/main).

Extend the original grammar with semgrep syntax
--

This is best done after everything else is set up. Some constructs
such as semgrep metavariables (`$FOO`) may already be valid constructs
in the language, in which case there's nothing to do. Some support for
the semgrep ellipsis `...` usually needs to be added as well.

You'll need to learn [how to create tree-sitter
grammars](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers).

1. Work from <code>semgrep-grammars/src/semgrep-<PL>LANG</PL></code> and use `make` and
   `make test` to build and test.
2. Add new test cases to `test/corpus/semgrep.text`.
3. Edit `grammar.js`.
4. Refer to the original grammar in
   <code>semgrep-grammars/src/tree-sitter-<PL>LANG</PL></code> to determine which rules to
   extend.

For an example of how to extend a language, you can:
* Look at what was done for the semgrep extensions of other languages
  in their respective `semgrep-*` folders.
* Look at how `tree-sitter-typescript` extends the JavaScript grammar.
  This is the file [`common/define-grammar.js` in the
  tree-sitter-typescript repository](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-typescript/blob/master/common/define-grammar.js).

Avoiding parsing conflicts is the trickiest part. Asking for help is encouraged.

ðŸ’¡ A note on the JavaScript syntax that's heavily used to define and extend grammars:

When possible, the development team prefers **shorthand** notation for anonymous functions made of a single expression:
```js
(x) => x
```
which is the same as
```js
(x) => { return x; }
```
which is itself the same as
```js
function(x) { return x; }
```

When extending any rule with an alternate choice such as `$.ellipsis`,
the simpler way is this one:

```js
expression: ($, previous) => choice(previous, $.ellipsis),
```

However, if the `previous` rule is known to be a `choice()`, you can avoid
one level of nesting and append to the original list of choices, which
is done as follows:
```js
expression: ($, previous) => choice(...previous.members, $.ellipsis),
```

Whether to use one or the other is a matter of taste.

Finally, on rare occasions where the rule body is more than a single expression, you'll have to use the curly brace or return syntax:
```js
expression: ($, previous) => {
  if (semgrep_ext)
    return choice(...previous.members, $.ellipsis);
  else
    return previous;
},
```

Parsing statistics
--

From a language's folder such as `lang/csharp`, two targets are
available to exercise the generated parser:

* `make test`: runs on `test/ok` and `test/xfail`
* `make stat`: downloads the code specified in `projects.txt` and
  parses the files whose extension matches those in `extensions.txt`,
  reporting parsing success in the form of a CSV file.

For gathering a good test corpus, you can use [GitHub
Search](https://github.com/search/advanced) or the script provided in
`scripts/most-starred-for-language.py`. For github searches, filter by
programming language and use a constraint to select large projects,
such as "> 100 forks". Collect the repository URLs and put them into
`projects.txt`.

Publish generated parsers
--

After you have pushed your ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep changes to the main
branch, do the following:
1. Check that the original `grammar.js`, `src/scanner.c`/`.cc` (if
   applicable) look clean and have minimal external dependencies.
2. In `ocaml-tree-sitter/lang/Makefile`, add language under
   'SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES' and 'STAT_LANGUAGES'.
3. In `ocaml-tree-sitter/lang` directory, run <code>./release <PL>LANG</PL> --dry-run</code>.
   If this looks good, please [ask someone from the Semgrep team](https://github.com/semgrep/ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep/blob/main/doc/release.md) to
   publish the code using <code>./release <PL>LANG</PL></code>.

### Troubleshooting

Various errors can occur along the way.

Compilation errors in C or C++ are usually due to a missing source
file `scanner.c` or `scanner.cc`, or a grammar with a name that
doesn't match the name inside the scanner file. JavaScript files may
also be missing, in particular in the case of grammars that extend
existing grammars such as C++ for C or TypeScript for
JavaScript. Check for `require()` calls in `grammar.js` and learn how
this NodeJS primitive resolves paths.

There may also be errors when generating or compiling
OCaml code. These are likely bugs in ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep and they should
be reported or fixed right away.

Here are some known types of parsing errors:

* A syntax error. The input program is in the wrong syntax or uses a
  recent feature that's not supported yet: `make test` or directly the
  <code>parse_<PL>LANG</PL></code> program will show the tree produced by tree-sitter with
  one or more `ERROR` nodes.
* A "reparsing" error. It's an error generated after the first
  successful parsing pass by the tree-sitter parser, during the
  reparsing pass by the OCaml code performed by the generated
  `Parse.ml` file.  The error message should tell you something like
  "cannot interpret tree-sitter's output", with details on what code
  failed to match what pattern. This is most likely a bug in
  `ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep`.
* A segmentation fault. This could be due to a bug in the
  OCaml/tree-sitter C bindings and should be fixed. A simple test case
  that reproduces the problem would be nice.
  See https://github.com/semgrep/ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep/issues/65

Parsing errors that are due to an incomplete or incorrect grammar should be recorded, and eventually reported or fixed in the upstream project.

We keep failing test cases in a `fail/` folder, preferably in the form of the minimal program suitable for a bug report, with a comment describing what was expected and what's going on.

<!-- tried to make this more descriptive but should check with Nat if I understood the goal correctly -->

## Update the `semgrep` repository

Now that you have added your new language <PL>LANG</PL> to `tree-sitter`, do the following:

1. Update [`generate.py`](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-interfaces/blob/main/generate.py) in the `semgrep-interfaces` repository with your new language.
1. In the `semgrep` repository, go to [`/src/parsing/Check_pattern.ml`](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/blob/develop/src/parsing/Check_pattern.ml), and add <PL>LANG</PL> to `lang_has_no_dollar_ids`. If the grammar has no dollar identifiers, add <PL>LANG</PL> above 'true'. Otherwise, add it above 'false'.
1. In [`/src/printing/Pretty_print_AST.ml`](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/blob/develop/src/printing/Pretty_print_AST.ml), add <PL>LANG</PL> to the appropriate functions:
   * `print_bool`
   * `if_stmt`
   * `while_stmt`
   * `do_while`
   * `for_stmt`
   * `def_stmt`
   * `return`
   * `break`
   * `continue`
   * `literal`
1. In [`/src/parsing/tests/Test_parsing.ml`](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/blob/develop/src/parsing/tests/Test_parsing.ml), add in <PL>LANG</PL> to `dump_tree_sitter_cst_lang`.
1. Inspect the other languages in `/languages` as a reference for what
   code to add. Create a new folder for your language.
1. Add the <code>semgrep-<PL>LANG</PL></code> repository as a submodule under
   <code>/languages/<PL>LANG</PL>/tree-sitter/</code> (`git submodule add ...`).
1. Create a file
   <code>/languages/<PL>LANG</PL>/tree-sitter/Parse_<PL>LANG</PL>_tree_sitter.ml</code>
   by copying the generated template `Boilerplate.ml` that you'll find
   in the <code>semgrep-<PL>LANG</PL></code> submodule.
   Add basic functionality to
   define the function `parse` and import the module
   `Parse_tree_sitter_helpers`.
   Look at other languages to get a better idea of how to
   define the parse file function. This file should contain something
   similar to:
   ```
   module H = Parse_tree_sitter_helpers

   let parse file =
    H.wrap_parser
        (fun () ->
            Parallel.backtrace_when_exn := false
            Parallel.invoke Tree_sitter_X.Parse.file file ()
        )
   ```
1. Create the missing `dune` files wherever you have OCaml source
   files (`.ml`, `.mli`) by imitating what was done for other
   languages.
1. Write a basic test case for your language in
    <code>tests/<PL>LANG</PL>/hello-world.<PL>EXT</PL></code>. This
    can just be a hello-world function.
1. Try to build the project using the usual commands
   (`make` or `make dev`).
1. Test that the command
   <code>semgrep-core/bin/semgrep-core -dump_tree_sitter_cst test/<PL>LANG</PL>/hello-world</code>
   prints out a CST for your language.

At this point, you're ready to start writing the translator from
the CST produced by the tree-sitter parser for <PL>LANG</PL>
into the generic AST used by Semgrep, accommodating all the languages
in a single AST type. It's recommended but not required to first
translate the CST into a language-specific AST before translating it
into the generic AST in a second step.

## Legal concerns

Be thankful for the authors of the original code, keep clearly visible
license notices, and make it easy to get back to the original projects:

* Make sure to preserve the `LICENSE` files. This should be listed in
  the `fyi.list` file.
* For sample input in `test/`, consider Public Domain ("The
  Unlicense") files or write your own, for simplicity.
  [GitHub Search](https://github.com/search/advanced)
  allows you to filter projects by license and by programming language.
