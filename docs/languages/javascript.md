# JavaScript frameworks and analyses

:::tip 
Semgrepâ€™s JavaScript coverage leverages framework-specific analysis capabilities that are not present in OSS. As a result, many framework specific Pro rules will **fail** to return findings if run on OSS. To ensure full security coverage, run: `semgrep login && semgrep ci`.
:::

## Semgrep Code analyses

- Framework-specific control flow analysis
- Inter-file analysis (cross-file)
- Inter-procedural analysis (cross-function)

### Coverage

Semgrep aims to provide comprehensive and accurate detection of common OWASP Top 10 issues in source code.

In addition to rules, the Semgrep engine itself can analyze code and implicit dataflows in the context of the following supported frameworks:


| Supported frameworks | Type of framework |
| -------              | ------            |
| Express              | Web framework     |
| Koa                  | Web framework     |
| Hapi                 | Web framework     |
| NestJS               | Web framework     |

## Benchmark results exclusive of [AI](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-assistant/overview) processing

Semgrep's benchmarking process involves scanning open source repositories, triaging the findings, and making iterative rule updates. This process was developed and is used internally by the Semgrep security research team to monitor and improve rule performance.

Results as of **February 25, 2025**:

| Benchmark | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| True positive rate (before AI processing) for latest `p/default` ruleset | 63% |
| Lines of code scanned | ~8 million |
| Repositories scanned | 153 |
| Findings triaged to date | ~600 |
