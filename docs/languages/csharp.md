# C# support

:::tip 
Semgrepâ€™s C# coverage leverages framework-specific analysis capabilities that are not present in OSS. As a result, many framework specific Pro rules will **fail** to return findings if run on OSS. To ensure full security coverage, run: `semgrep login && semgrep ci`.
:::

## Semgrep Code analyses

* Framework-specific control flow analysis 
* Interfile analysis (cross-file)
* Interprocedural analysis (cross-function)

## Coverage 

Semgrep aims to provide comprehensive and accurate detection of common OWASP Top 10 issues in source code.

In addition to rules, the Semgrep engine itself can analyze code and implicit dataflows in the context of the following supported frameworks:

<table>
    <thead><tr>
        <td><strong>Framework / library</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Category</strong></td>
    </tr></thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Django</td>
        <td>Web framework</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Flask</td>
        <td>Web framework</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>FastAPI</td>
        <td>Web framework</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
