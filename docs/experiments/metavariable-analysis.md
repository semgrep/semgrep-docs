# Metavariable analysis

Metavariable analysis was created to support some metavariable inspection techniques that are difficult to express with existing rules but have "simple" binary classifier behavior. Currently, this syntax supports two analyzers: `redos` and `entropy`

## ReDoS

```yaml
metavariable-analysis:
    analyzer: redos
    metavariable: $VARIABLE
```
RegEx denial of service is caused by poorly-constructed regular expressions that exhibit exponential runtime when fed specifically-crafted inputs. The `redos` analyzer uses known RegEx antipatterns to determine if the target expression is potentially vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking.

## Entropy

```yaml
metavariable-analysis:
    analyzer: entropy
    metavariable: $VARIABLE
```
Entropy is a common approach for detecting secret strings - many existing tools leverage a combination of entropy calculations and RegEx for secret detection. This analyzer returns `true` if a metavariable has high entropy (randomness) relative to the English language.
