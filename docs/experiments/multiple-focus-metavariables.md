# Using multiple focus metavariables

Semgrep matches all pieces of code captured by focus metavariables when you specify them in a rule. Include the metavariables that you want to focus on by specifying each in a YAML list. This enables Semgrep to match these metavariables regardless of their position in code.

:::info
This feature is using `focus-metavariable`, see [`focus-metavariable`](/writing-rules/rule-syntax/#focus-metavariable) documentation for more information.  
:::

There are two methods of focusing Semgrep on multiple metavariables. Each of them can lead to different results:

- **Recommended**, set union: Including `focus-metavariable` with more metavariables directly under the `patterns` key returns results regardless of whether there is an overlap between these variables:
    ```yaml
        patterns:
          - pattern: foo($X, ..., $Y)
          - focus-metavariable: 
            - $X
            - $Y
    ```
    See the following example:

- **Advanced**, set intersection: Including more `focus-metavariable` keys with different metavariables under the `pattern` returns results **only** for the overlapping region of all the focused code:
    ```yaml
        patterns:
          - pattern: foo($X, ..., $Y)
          - focus-metavariable: $X
          - focus-metavariable: $Y
    ```
    See the following example:

:::tip
Among many use cases, the **recommended** syntax for using multiple metavariables allows you to simplify taint analysis rule writing. For example, see the following rule:
