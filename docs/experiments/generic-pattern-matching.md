# Generic pattern matching
## Introduction
Semgrep can match matches generic patterns in languages that it doesn‚Äôt yet support. You can use generic pattern matching for languages that don‚Äôt yet have a parser, configuration files, and other structured data, such as HTML or XML. Generic pattern matching is experimental.

As an example, consider this rule:
```yaml
rules:
- id: terraform-all-origins-allowed
  patterns:
  - pattern-inside: cors_rule { ... }
  - pattern: allowed_origins = ["*"]
  languages:
  - generic
  severity: WARNING
  message: CORS rule on bucket permits any origin
```

The above rule matches this code snippet:

```bash
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "s3-website-test-open.hashicorp.com"
  acl    = "private"

  cors_rule {
    allowed_headers = ["*"]
    allowed_methods = ["PUT", "POST"]
    allowed_origins = ["*"]  # <--- Matches here
    expose_headers  = ["ETag"]
    max_age_seconds = 3000
  }
}
```

Generic pattern matching has the following properties:

* A document is interpreted as a nested sequence of ASCII words, ASCII punctuation, and other bytes.
* `...` allows skipping non-matching elements, up to 10 lines down the last match.
* `$X` (metavariable) matches any word.
* `$...X` (ellipsis metavariable) matches a sequence of words, up to 10 lines down the last match.
* Indentation determines primary nesting in the document.
* Common ASCII braces `()`, `[]`, and `{}` introduce secondary nesting but only within single lines. Therefore, misinterpreted or mismatched braces don't disturb the structure of the rest of document.
* The document must be at least as indented as the pattern: any indentation specified in the pattern must be honored in the document.

## Caveats and limitations

Generic mode should work fine with any human-readable text, as long as it‚Äôs primarily based on ASCII symbols. In practice, it might work great with some languages and less well with others. In general, it‚Äôs possible or even easy to write code in weird ways that will prevent generic mode from matching. Note it‚Äôs not good for detecting malicious code. For example, in HTML one can write `&#x48;&#x65;&#x6C;&#x6C;&#x6F`; instead of `Hello` and this is not something the generic mode would match if the pattern is `Hello`, unlike if it had full HTML support.

With respect to Semgrep operators and features:

* metavariable support is limited to capturing a single ‚Äúword‚Äù, which is a token of the form [A-Za-z0-9_]+. They can‚Äôt capture sequences of tokens such as hello, world (in this case there are 3 tokens: `hello`, `,`, and `world`).
* the ellipsis operator is supported and spans at most 10 lines
* pattern operators like either/not/inside are supported
* inline regular expressions for strings (`"=~/word.*/"`) is not supported 

## Troubleshooting

### Common pitfall #1: not enough `...`

Rule of thumb:
> If the pattern commonly matches many lines, use `... ...` (20 lines), or `... ... ...` (30 lines) etc. to make sure to match all the lines.

Here's an innocuous pattern that should match the call to a function `f()`:
```
f(...)
```
It matches the following code [just fine](https://semgrep.dev/s/9v9R):
```
f(
  1,
  2,
  3,
  4,
  5,
  6,
  7,
  8,
  9
)
```

But it will [fail](https://semgrep.dev/s/1z6Q) here because the function arguments span more than 10 lines:
```
f(
  1,
  2,
  3,
  4,
  5,
  6,
  7,
  8,
  9,
  10
)
```

The [solution](https://semgrep.dev/s/9v9R) is to use multiple `...` in the pattern:
```
f(... ...)
```

### Common pitfall #2: not enough indentation

Rule of thumb:
> If the target code is always indented, use indentation in the pattern.

In the following example, we want to match the `system` sections containing a `name` field:
```
# match here
[system]
  name = "Debian"

# DON'T match here
[system]
  max_threads = 2
[user]
  name = "Admin Overlord"
```

‚ùå This pattern will [incorrectly](https://semgrep.dev/s/ry1A) catch the `name` field in the `user` section:
```
[system]
...
name = ...
```

‚úÖ This pattern will catch [only](https://semgrep.dev/s/bXAr) the `name` field in the `system` section:
```
[system]
  ...
  name = ...
```

### Handling line-based input

This section explains how to use Semgrep's generic mode to match
single lines of code using an ellipsis metavariable. Many simple
configuration formats are collections of key and value pairs delimited
by newlines. For example, to extract the `password` value from the
following made-up input:

```
username = bob
password = p@$$w0rd
server = example.com
```

Unfortunately, the following pattern does not match the whole line. In generic mode, metavariables only capture a single word (alphanumeric sequence):

```
password = $PASSWORD
```

This pattern matches the input file but does not assign the value `p` to `$PASSWORD` instead of the full value `p@$$w0rd`.

To match an arbitrary sequence of items and capture their value in the example:

1. Use a named ellipsis, by changing the pattern to the following:

    ```yaml
    password = $...PASSWORD
    ```

    This still leads Semgrep to capture too much information. The value assigned to `$...PASSWORD` are now `p@$$w0rd` and<br />
    `server = example.com`. In generic mode, an ellipsis extends until the end of the current block or up to 10 lines below, whichever comes first. To prevent this behavior, continue with the next step.

2. In the Semgrep rule, specify the following key:
   
    ```yaml
    generic_ellipsis_max_span: 0
    ```

    This option forces the ellipsis operator to match patterns within a single line.
    Example of the [resulting rule](https://semgrep.dev/playground/s/returntocorp:password-in-config-file):

    ```yaml
    id: password-in-config-file
    pattern: |
      password = $...PASSWORD
    options:
      # prevent ellipses from matching multiple lines
      generic_ellipsis_max_span: 0
    message: |
      password found in config file: $...PASSWORD
    languages:
      - generic
    severity: WARNING
    ```

## Command line example

Sample pattern: `exec(...)`

Sample target file `exec.txt` contains:
```bash
import exec as safe_function
safe_function(user_input)

exec("ls")

exec(some_var)

some_exec(foo)

exec (foo)

exec (
    bar
)

# exec(foo)

print("exec(bar)")
```

Output:
```bash
$ semgrep -l generic -e 'exec(...)` exec.text
7:exec("ls")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11:exec(some_var)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19:exec (foo)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23:exec (
24:128
25: ¬† ¬†bar
26:129
27:)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31:# exec(foo)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
35:print("exec(bar)")

## Semgrep Registry rules for generic pattern matching
You can peruse [existing generic rules](https://semgrep.dev/r?lang=generic&sev=ERROR,WARNING,INFO&tag=dgryski.semgrep-go,hazanasec.semgrep-rules,ajinabraham.njsscan,best-practice,security,java-spring,go-stdlib,ruby-stdlib,java-stdlib,js-node,nodejsscan,owasp,dlint,react,performance,compatibility,portability,correctness,maintainability,secuirty,mongodb,experimental,caching,robots-denied,missing-noreferrer,missing-noopener) in the Semgrep registry. In general, short patterns on structured data will perform the best.

## Cheat sheet
Some examples of what will and will not match on the `generic` tab of the Semgrep cheat sheet below:

## Hidden bonus
In the Semgrep code the generic pattern matching implementation is called **spacegrep** because it tokenizes based on whitespace (and because it sounds cool üòé).
