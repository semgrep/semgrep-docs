# Symbolic propagation

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import pandas

def test1():
    # ruleid: test
    pandas.DataFrame(x).index.set_value(a, b, c)

def test2():
    df = pandas.DataFrame(x)
    ix = df.index
    # ruleid: test
    ix.set_value(a, b, c)
```

If we tried to match the pattern `pandas.DataFrame(...).index.set_value(...)` against the above code, Semgrep would normally match `test1` but not `test2`. It does not match `test2` because there are intermediate assignments, and Semgrep does not know that `ix` is equals to `df.index` or that `df` is equals to `pandas.DataFrame(x)`. If we wanted Semgrep to match such code, we had to be explicit about it.

Symbolic propagation is a generalization of [constant propagation](../../writing-rules/data-flow/constant-propagation/) that addresses this limitation. It enables Semgrep to perform matching modulo variable assignments. Thus, Semgrep is then able to match both `test1` and `test2` with the same simple pattern. This feature needs to be enabled explicitly via rule `options:` by setting `symbolic_propagation: true`.
