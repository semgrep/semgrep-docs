# `focus-metavariable`

The experimental `focus-metavariable` operator puts the focus, or _zooms in_, on the code region matched by a metavariable. For example, to find all functions arguments annotated with the type `bad` write the following pattern:

```yaml
pattern: |
  def $FUNC(..., $ARG : bad, ...):
    ...
```

This works but it matches the entire function definition. Sometimes, this is not desirable, for example, if you are using [Semgrep App](https://semgrep.dev/login) and you have triaged a finding generated by this pattern, the same finding may show up again as new if you make any change to the definition of the function!

To specify that you are only interested in the code matched by a particular metavariable, in our example `$ARG`, use `focus-metavariable`.

Note that `focus-metavariable: $ARG` is not the same as `pattern: $ARG`! Using `pattern: $ARG` finds all the uses of the parameter `x` which is not what we want! (Note that `pattern: $ARG` does not match the formal parameter declaration, because in this context `$ARG` only matches expressions.)

In short, `focus-metavariable: $X` is not a pattern in itself, it does not perform any matching, it only focuses the matching on the code already bound to `$X` by other patterns. Whereas `pattern: $X` matches `$X` against your code (and in this context, `$X` only matches expressions)!
