# Resolve findings in your pull or merge request

Findings resolution involves the assessment of a finding, then either fixing or ignoring it. You can fix or triage findings from your source code manager (SCM); fixing or triaging (ignoring) does **not** require a Semgrep AppSec Platform account.

Findings are primarily presented to developers through **pull request (PR) or merge request (MR) comments**. These findings are generated from rules that your AppSec team has vetted or approved. 

Findings from these rules are meant to be **fixed** or **remediated** rather than ignored unless the finding is a false positive.

In **typical coding workflows**, it is recommended to fix or ignore findings as part of your **code review** process; the results of triage or remediation in your SCM are synchronized with Semgrep AppSec Platform.

However, if you have accumulated many findings to ignore, it may be faster to perform bulk triage actions in Semgrep AppSec Platform. See [Resolve findings through the Semgrep web app](/for-developers/resolve-findings-through-app).

## Prerequisites and optional features

- The procedures described in this guide rely on PR or MR comments. Ensure that your security team has enabled this feature.
- To receive AI-assisted remediation, your security team must enable the **Semgrep Assistant** feature.

<!--
Many factors affect whether or not a finding should be fixed: whether it is a true or false positive, if the fix can be applied within deadlines, if the finding is easily exploitable, the degree of the finding's severity, and so on.

Here are some of the most common Semgrep rule attributes used to quickly assess findings:

- **Severity**. Prioritize fixing critical and high severity findings.
- **Confidence**. Higher confidence rules indicate a higher chance of true positives. 
- **Exploit prediction scoring system (EPSS) score**. For SCA findings, higher EPSS scores should be fixed.
- **Reachability**. Prioritize updating dependencies or refactoring code to patch reachable dependency vulnerabilities.
-->

Your SCM is the most common environment in which to fix findings. Semgrep provides several features to help you fix findings quickly.

## Parts of a PR or MR comment

## Resolve findings

Different types of findings require different remediations. The following sections describe how Semgrep can help you resolve a finding.

### Autofix

Some Semgrep Code findings provide an **autofix**, which can be human-written or generated by Semgrep Assistant. The fix can be committed directly, such as by clicking **Commit suggestion** in GitHub repositories. This is the fastest way to fix a finding. 

All Semgrep-supported SCMs provide this feature.

_**Figure**. GitHub enables you to commit the suggestion from Semgrep directly, fixing the finding._

:::info
If a line of code contains several findings, Semgrep does not provide the autofix or **Commit suggestion** feature to prevent fixes from conflicting.

### Semgrep Assistant remediations

Semgrep Assistant provides the following AI-powered security recommendations:

- Step-by-step instructions.
- AI-written code fixes if a human-written autofix is not available and a code fix can resolve the finding.
- "Safe to ignore" suggestions.

## Ignore findings

If the finding is a false positive, acceptable risk, or similar, you can choose to ignore the finding. You can ignore findings directly from your SCM by **replying** to the finding comment. 

1. Find an open comment created by Semgrep AppSec Platform in your pull request or merge request:
    ![Screenshot of Semgrep AppSec Platform comment in GitHub](/img/semgrep-app-comment-github-beta.png#md-width)
2. In a subsequent comment, reply with the action you want to take. You must provide a **reason** to help the reader understand why the finding has been triaged as **ignored**:

    | Comment | Description |
    | - | - |
    | <code>/fp <span className="placeholder">&lt;REASON&gt;</span></code> | Triage a finding as **Ignored** with the triage reason **false positive**. |
    | <code>/ar <span className="placeholder">&lt;REASON&gt;</span></code> | Triage a finding as **Ignored** with the triage reason **acceptable risk**. |
    | <code>/other <span className="placeholder">&lt;REASON&gt;</span></code> | Triage a finding as **Ignored** without specifying the reason; the triage reason value is set to **No triage reason**. |
    | <code>/open <span className="placeholder">&lt;REASON&gt;</span></code> | Reopen a finding that has been triaged as **Ignored**. The comment is optional. |
    | <code>/remember <span className="placeholder">&lt;REASON&gt;</span></code> | [Add Assistant Memories](/semgrep-assistant/customize#add-memories-beta). |

### Re-run a job or workflow

After resolving or triaging the findings in your PR or MR, you must re-run the Semgrep job or workflow. See the following list for a link to your CI provider's documentation:
