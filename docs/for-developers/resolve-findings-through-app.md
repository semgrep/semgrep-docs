# Resolve findings through the Semgrep web app

This guide explains how you can view and triage findings in bulk through the Semgrep AppSec Platform web app.

:::caution
- Not all organizations allow developers to use the AppSec Platform; ask your security team if you have access.
- When triaging through Semgrep AppSec Platform, developers typically triage findings specific to their **branch**. Avoid triaging findings in branches that are not yours to triage.
:::

## Prerequisites

You must have an existing Semgrep org account. See [Sign in to Semgrep](/for-developers/signin).
