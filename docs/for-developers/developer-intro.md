# Semgrep for developers

This guide to Semgrep is for developers who are using Semgrep in a team or organizational setting. Learn Semgrep to:

- Lint your code
- Triage security issues
- Automate code reviews among your peers
- Follow security practices set by security engineers

:::tip Developer and AppSec role
- If you are a developer responsible for your **own** security program in personal projects, see the **Quickstart** and **Core deployment** docs.
:::

## Semgrep AppSec Platform

Semgrep AppSec Platform, or Semgrep (**sem**antic **grep**), is a software suite for implementing and tracking the success of security programs. AppSec engineers use Semgrep to detect, triage, and remediate findings.

Developers primarily use Semgrep to scan for issues in their code. Issues detected by Semgrep are called **findings**. Semgrep performs static analysis and several other analyses to detect bugs, vulnerabilities in dependencies, and leaked secrets.

Semgrep scans can be run in various environments, including popular IDEs, on your local machine, and in CI.

## Code scanning with Semgrep

Semgrep enables you to:

- Search for code semantically
- Codify those search parameters as a **rule**
- Run the rule on every keystroke, commit, pull request, and merge

### 
### Semgrep is deterministic and transparent


### Semgrep is fast

### Semgrep is customizable

### Semgrep's approach to security: secure guardrails

Your interactions with Semgrep may vary depending on your organization's deployment of Semgrep.
