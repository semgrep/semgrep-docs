# Sign in and install Semgrep

Signing in to Semgrep enables you to use your organization's custom Semgrep rules and configurations when you perform local scans with Semgrep. This ensures that everyone in the organization uses the same rules and analyses.

When you sign in to the [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Semgrep AppSec Platform web app](https://semgrep.dev/login), you can also view findings for projects (repositories) that have been assigned to you.

## Semgrep in multiple environments

If you have not yet created a Semgrep account, it is **recommended** to first sign in to the Semgrep web app. This process creates a creates a **personal** account, which you can then use to **join** your organization's Semgrep account. This grants you access to your organization's Semgrep configuration.

If you use Semgrep in your CLI or IDE, you must sign in from those environments as well. It is recommended to sign in from these interfaces **after** you have signed in to your organization account in the web app.

## Prerequisites

- Confirm with your security team that there is an existing organization account for you to join.
- For CLI and IDE scans, see [Prerequisites > Command line tool](/prerequisites#semgrep-command-line-tool) to ensure that your machine meets Semgrep's requirements.

## Signing in to the web app

In a typical Semgrep deployment, your company creates an **org** that you can sign in to and join using your GitHub, GitLab, or SSO credentials. Your organization will let you know through a notice or announcement once you can sign in.

 <JoinAnOrg />

After signing in to your org's account, you can now sign in from other environments, such as your CLI or IDE.

## Set up Semgrep in the CLI

#### Prerequisites

<Install />

To sign in to Semgrep:

1. Ensure that you are signed in to your **org account** in the Semgrep web app.
1. Enter the following command in your CLI:
    ```bash
    semgrep login
    ``` 
1. Running this command launches a browser window, but you can also use the link that's returned in the CLI to proceed.
1. In the Semgrep CLI login dialog, click **Activate** to proceed.

You are now ready to run local scans with your org's Semgrep configuration.

## Run local scans

To run a local scan using your organization's rules, enter:

```bash
semgrep ci --dry-run
```

The `--dry-run` flag ensures that your scans are not uploaded to the Semgrep web app. This is recommended because your code could be a work in progress, subject to change, whereas code uploaded as a PR or MR usually indicates the code is ready for review.
