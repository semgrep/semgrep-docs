# Pricing and billing

## Semgrep products and usage model

The following Semgrep products are free to use:

* Semgrep OSS Engine
* Semgrep Code (free for up to **10 contributors** under the Team tier)
* Semgrep Cloud Platform (free for up to 10 contributors under the Team tier)
* Semgrep Supply Chain (free for up to 10 contributors under the Team tier)

**Semgrep OSS Engine** is open source software (OSS), licensed under LGPL 2.1. It is a fast static analysis command line tool for finding bugs and enforcing code standards. It can be run locally or in continuous integration (CI).

**Semgrep Code**, which builds on Semgrep OSS Engine, provides additional features that enable developer and security teams to triage security vulnerabilities, set up notifications, and enforce organizational coding standards. Semgrep Code includes Semgrep Cloud Platform (SCP). Semgrep Code has both free and paid tiers.

Semgrep Code’s paid tiers include **Semgrep Pro Engine** and **Semgrep Pro rules**. These provide **interprocedural and interfile analysis**, producing high confidence findings for a variety of OWASP top ten vulnerabilities.

This page contains information for Semgrep Code and Semgrep OSS. For Semgrep Supply Chain, a software composition analysis (SCA) product, see the [Semgrep Pricing](https://semgrep.dev/pricing) page.

## Semgrep Code and Semgrep OSS Engine

The following tables provide an overview of features and their availability based on tier.

### Organizational management and usage limits

| Feature           | Semgrep OSS | Semgrep Code Community | Semgrep Code Team |
| -------       | --------- | ------- | -------- |
| **Member limit**  | n/a         | 20 developers          | ♾️ unlimited      |
| **Project limit** | n/a         | ♾️ unlimited           | ♾️ unlimited      |

Notes:

* Semgrep OSS does not support any member count function.
* Member usage limits are visible in your **[Settings page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings) > Upgrade** tab.
* If your organization exceeds the member limit:
    * Only the 20 most recent developers can view findings from Semgrep scans.
    * Overlimit findings data is retained for three months. When your organization goes below the usage limit, or upgrades to Team or Enterprise, the findings data will be accessible again.
    * You are notified of a 30-day grace period through in-app notifications and emails. After this grace period ends, additional developers (the 21st onwards) will not receive notifications or comments. Findings introduced by additional developers won't be surfaced in Semgrep Cloud Platform.

Notes:

* **Custom rules** are rules that you can create and save through either the [Playground](https://semgrep.dev/playground) or the Editor. The Playground and the [Editor](/semgrep-code/editor) are online tools where you can write your rule patterns and test them on sample code. You must be signed in to use the Editor.
* Developers can create fixes to their rules through an `autofix` key. For example, when banning outdated libraries, setting an autofix value with the correct library replaces the banned library.
* Semgrep Cloud Platform provides this functionality with **Autofix through PR/MR comments**. These comments appear as suggestions that developers can commit with a single click.
* **Custom rule messages** can be applied to public and private rules.
* **Semgrep Pro Engine** enables interfile tracking within a codebase, keeping track of class and function definitions beyond a single file.
* **Developer feedback** is a means for developers to communicate to security or rule-writing teams about a rule's precision. Discover what rules result in false positives and refine them through this feature.
* **Custom language support** is available for Enterprise tier users.

### Integrations and notifications

Notes:

* **Automatic CI/CD integration** means that repositories added to Semgrep are scanned as part of the code repository's CI pipeline when a pull request is made.
* **Webhook integration** uses a generic webhook to send JSON messages. These messages are triggered when a policy is changed, a new scan runs, or a new finding has emerged.
* **Jira integration** allows organizations to directly create Jira tickets from a finding.

## Choosing a Semgrep App tier

Semgrep App has three tiers:

| Tier | Price | Description |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
| **Community** | Free | For individuals and small teams that need the essentials to secure their code. |
| **Team** | US$40 monthly per developer per product | For bigger teams that want to scale their usage and access all features.  |
| **Enterprise** | Custom pricing | For organizations needing custom features, control, and support. |

Semgrep App integrates with a GitHub or GitLab account at either the organizational or individual level. There is no limit to the number of members in an organization for all tiers.

Billing depends on the number of **developers**. Any organization member who has made a commit in a project within the past 30 days is considered a **developer**.

Members who do **not** make any commits on the code do not need to pay for Semgrep and are not billed. Semgrep Team tier features apply to the entire organization, even if not all members are billed.

### Comparing free and paid tier features

#### Organizational management and usage limits

| Feature  | Community | Team | Enterprise |
| -------  | --------- | ------- | -------- |
| **Member limit** | 20 developers | ♾️  unlimited | ♾️  unlimited |
| **Project limit** |♾️  unlimited | ♾️  unlimited | ♾️  unlimited |

Notes:

* Member usage limits are visible in your **[Settings page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings) > Upgrade** tab.
* If your organization exceeds the member limit:
    * Only the 20 most recent developers can view findings from Semgrep scans.
    * Overlimit findings data is retained for three months. When your organization goes below the usage limit, or upgrades to Team or Enterprise, the findings data will be accessible again.
    * You are notified of a 30-day grace period through in-app notifications and emails. After this grace period ends, additional developers (the 21st onwards) will not receive notifications or comments. Findings introduced by additional developers won't be surfaced in Semgrep App.

## Determining your plan needs

### Number of developers

Within your team or organization, assess the number of members that make commits. That determines the number of **licenses** needed for the plan purchase.

For example, if a project has 4 unique developers who create commits during the billing period while Semgrep is scanning their repositories, only 4 licenses are required even if the organization has a total of 10 members. If these unique developers commit to many projects within the same organization, they are counted once, so no additional cost is charged.

All members of the organization, regardless of developer (license) status, have access to paid features for the chosen tier. This means that project managers and other non-programming roles can still view the Semgrep Cloud Platform dashboard.

### Semgrep add-on reconciliation of licenses

If the organization exceeds the number of purchased licenses, the organization will be charged based on the number of licenses that exceeded the purchased amount. The additional charge starts the month after the use of licenses exceeds the contracted amount.

Check in with your Semgrep Account Executive every **60 days** if you need more licenses than initially purchased.

#### Example of license reconciliation

On January 21st, you purchased annual licenses for 50 developers of Semgrep Supply Chain’s Team tier ($40 per developer per month). The 21st of the month is the start date of the annual contract. In the following month, on February 28th, the number of used developer licenses exceeded the original purchased quantity by 20 users. This requires a contract adjustment.

Contract adjustment:

* Since the organization’s use exceeded the amount of purchased licenses on February 28th, the future date of March 21st is selected to align with the remaining months in the contract. There are 10 months remaining in the contract.
* The additional amount charged, the add-on cost, is $8,000 ($40 per developer per month x 10 months x 20 users).
* Resulting add-on cost: **$8,000**

## Upgrading your plan

To upgrade to the **Team tier** through a **credit card**:

1. In the Settings page, select the Payment tab.
2. Select the number of developers to purchase licenses for.
3. Fill in your payment details.


![Screenshot of payment menu](/img/billing-and-pricing-payment.png)<br />
