# Pricing and billing


Semgrep's various functionalities are available through several tiers:

<dl>
<dt>OSS tier</dt>
<dd>The OSS (open source software) tier includes Semgrep OSS Engine, a fast static analysis command line tool for finding bugs and and enforcing code standards. It is licensed under LGPL 2.1. </dd>
<dt>Team tier</dt>
<dd>The Team tier includes Semgrep Code and Semgrep Supply Chain (SSC), which enables users to scan both first-party and third-party open source dependencies. It also includes Semgrep Cloud Platform, a web app enabling users to manage users, organizations, repositories, and scans.</dd>
<dt>Enterprise tier</dt>
<dd>This tier offers custom features and the highest levels of support in addition to all of the features in the Team tier.</dd>
</dl>

Semgrep is CI provider-agnostic for all tiers. All Semgrep tiers can scan the following repository providers or SCMs (source code managers):

* GitHub
* GitLab
* Bitbucket
* Azure Repos

:::caution Important dates
* **For Semgrep Team tier users:** Usage limits will be enforced after July 31, 2023.

## Semgrep OSS and Team tier

The following tables provide an overview of features and their availability based on tier.

Notes:

* **Custom rules** are rules that you can create and save through either the [Playground](https://semgrep.dev/playground) or the Editor. The Playground and the [Editor](/semgrep-code/editor) are online tools where you can write your rule patterns and test them on sample code. You must be signed in to use the Editor.
* Developers can create fixes to their rules through an `autofix` key. For example, when banning outdated libraries, setting an autofix value with the correct library replaces the banned library.
* Semgrep Cloud Platform provides this functionality with **Autofix through PR/MR comments**. These comments appear as suggestions that developers can commit with a single click.
* **Custom rule messages** can be applied to public and private rules.
* **Semgrep Pro Engine** enables interfile tracking within a codebase, keeping track of class and function definitions beyond a single file.
* **Developer feedback** is a means for developers to communicate to security or rule-writing teams about a rule's precision. Discover what rules result in false positives and refine them through this feature.
* **Custom language support** is available for Enterprise tier users.


Notes:

* There is no limit to the number of integrations or notification channels. You can make more than one integration of any type.
* **Automatic CI/CD integration** means that repositories added to Semgrep are scanned as part of the code repository's CI pipeline when a pull request is made.
* **Webhook integration** uses a generic webhook to send JSON messages. These messages are triggered when a policy is changed, a new scan runs, or a new finding has emerged.
* **Jira integration** allows organizations to directly create Jira tickets from a finding.

## Determining your plan needs

### Number of developers

Within your team or organization, assess the number of members that make commits. That determines the number of **licenses** needed for the plan purchase.

For example, if a project has 4 unique developers who create commits during the billing period while Semgrep is scanning their repositories, only 4 licenses are required even if the organization has a total of 10 members. If these unique developers commit to many projects within the same organization, they are counted once, so no additional cost is charged.

All members of the organization, regardless of developer (license) status, have access to paid features for the chosen tier. This means that project managers and other non-programming roles can still view the Semgrep Cloud Platform dashboard.

### Semgrep add-on reconciliation of licenses

If the organization exceeds the number of purchased licenses, the organization will be charged based on the number of licenses that exceeded the purchased amount. The additional charge starts the month after the use of licenses exceeds the contracted amount.

Check in with your Semgrep Account Executive every **60 days** if you need more licenses than initially purchased.

#### Example of license reconciliation

On January 21st, you purchased annual licenses for 50 developers of Semgrep Supply Chain’s Team tier ($40 per developer per month). The 21st of the month is the start date of the annual contract. In the following month, on February 28th, the number of used developer licenses exceeded the original purchased quantity by 20 users. This requires a contract adjustment.

Contract adjustment:

* Since the organization’s use exceeded the amount of purchased licenses on February 28th, the future date of March 21st is selected to align with the remaining months in the contract. There are 10 months remaining in the contract.
* The additional amount charged, the add-on cost, is $8,000 ($40 per developer per month x 10 months x 20 users).
* Resulting add-on cost: **$8,000**
