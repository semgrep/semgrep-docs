\*Private rules refer to rules that are guaranteed a private access scope in the cloud. This scope of access does not apply to Semgrep OSS, as it is purely CLI-based.<br />
† Policy-based workflows provide security teams a means to block merges, leave PR/MR comments, or silently monitor for potential issues based on the presence of a finding.

## Determining your plan needs

### Number of contributors

Within your team or organization, assess the number of **contributors**. Contributors are members of your organization that make commits. That determines the number of **licenses** needed for the plan purchase.

For example, if a project has 4 unique contributors who create commits during the billing period while Semgrep is scanning their repositories, only 4 licenses are required even if the organization has a total of 10 members. If these unique contributors commit to many projects within the same organization, they are counted once, so no additional cost is charged.

:::info Usage limits
Semgrep Team tier is free for the first 10 contributors. You only need to buy licenses for contributors over 10.
:::

All members of the organization, regardless of contributor (license) status, have access to paid features for the chosen tier. This means that project managers and other non-programming roles can still view the Semgrep Cloud Platform dashboard.

### Semgrep add-on reconciliation of licenses

If the organization exceeds the number of purchased licenses, the organization will be charged based on the number of licenses that exceeded the purchased amount. The additional charge starts the month after the use of licenses exceeds the contracted amount.

Check in with your Semgrep Account Executive every **60 days** if you need more licenses than initially purchased.

#### Example of license reconciliation

On January 21st, you purchased annual licenses for 50 developers of Semgrep Supply Chain’s Team tier ($40 per developer per month). The 21st of the month is the start date of the annual contract. In the following month, on February 28th, the number of used developer licenses exceeded the original purchased quantity by 20 users. This requires a contract adjustment.

Contract adjustment:

- Since the organization’s use exceeded the amount of purchased licenses on February 28th, the future date of March 21st is selected to align with the remaining months in the contract. There are 10 months remaining in the contract.
- The additional amount charged, the add-on cost, is $8,000 ($40 per developer per month x 10 months x 20 users).
- Resulting add-on cost: **$8,000**

## Upgrading your plan

To upgrade to the Semgrep Code **Team tier** through a **credit card**:

1. In the Settings page, select the Payment tab.
2. Select the number of developers to purchase licenses for.
3. Fill in your payment details.
