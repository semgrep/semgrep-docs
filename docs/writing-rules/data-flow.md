# Data-flow analysis

Semgrep can perform intra-procedural flow-sensitive analyses. The data-flow engine still has several limitations, therefore expect both false positives and false negatives. False positives could be removed by using [pattern-not](../writing-rules/rule-syntax.md#pattern-not).

A non-exhaustive list of current limitations:

- The analyses are not aware of _aliasing_.
- The analyses do not track individual elements in data structures, although there is limited support for record fields.
- `break`, `continue`, and `switch` statements are not properly handled yet.
- `try-catch-finally` is only partially supported, not all possible execution paths are considered.

Data-flow analysis is used for [constant propagation](#constant-propagation).

## Constant propagation

Semgrep supports intra-procedural constant propagation. This tracks whether a variable must carry a constant value at each point in the program.

For example:

## Taint tracking

Semgrep supports intra-file [taint tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taint_checking). Taint tracking rules must specify `mode: taint`. Additionally, the following operators are enabled:

- `pattern-sources` (required)
- `pattern-sinks` (required)
- `pattern-sanitizers` (optional)

For example:
