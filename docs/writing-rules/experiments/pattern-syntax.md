## Pattern syntax (experimental)

Patterns are the expressions Semgrep uses to match code when it scans for vulnerabilities. This article describes the new syntax for Semgrep pattern operators.

:::warning
These patterns are **experimental** and subject to change.

You can't mix and match existing pattern syntax with the experimental syntax.
:::

## Pattern matching

### `pattern`

In the existing syntax, the `pattern` operator looks for code matching its expression. However, `pattern` is no longer required when using the experimental syntax. For example, you can use `...` wherever `pattern: "..."` appears. For example, you can omit `pattern` and write the following:

```code
any:
  - "badthing1"
  - "badthing2"
  - "badthing3"
```

or, for multi-line patterns

```code
any:
  - |
      manylines(
        badthinghere($A)
      )
  - |
      orshort()
```

:::info
You don't need double quotes for a single-line pattern when omitting the `pattern` key, but note that this can cause YAML rendering issues.
:::

### `any`

Replaces [pattern-either](/writing-rules/rule-syntax/#pattern-either). Matches any of the patterns specified.

```code
any:
  - <pat1>
  - <pat2> 
    ...
  - <patn>
```

### `all`

Replaces [patterns](/writing-rules/rule-syntax/#patterns). Matches all of the patterns specified.

```code
all:
  - <pat1>
  - <pat2> 
    ...
  - <patn>
```

### `inside`

Replaces [pattern-inside](/writing-rules/rule-syntax/#pattern-inside). Match any of the sub-patterns inside of the primary pattern.

```code
inside: 
  any: 
    - <pat1> 
    - <pat2>
```

Alternatively:

```code
any:
  - inside: <pat1>
  - inside: <pat2>
```

### `not`

Replaces [pattern-not](/writing-rules/rule-syntax/#pattern-not). Accepts any pattern and does **not** match on those patterns.

```code
not:
  any:
    - <pat1>
    - <pat2>
```

Alternatively:

```code
all:
  - not: <pat1>
  - not: <pat2>
```

### `regex`

Replaces [pattern-regex](/writing-rules/rule-syntax/#pattern-regex) Matches based on the regex provided.

```code
regex: "(.*)"
```

## Metavariables

Metavariables are an abstraction to match code when you donâ€™t know the value or contents ahead of time. They're similar to [capture groups](https://regexone.com/lesson/capturing_groups) in regular expressions and can be used to track values across a specific code scope. This
includes variables, functions, arguments, classes, object methods, imports,
exceptions, and more.

Metavariables begin with a `$` and can only contain uppercase characters, `_`, or digits. Names like `$x` or `$some_value` are invalid. Examples of valid metavariables include `$X`, `$WIDGET`, or `$USERS_2`.

### Changes to metavariables

Unlike Semgrep's existing pattern syntax, the following no longer occur under `pattern` or `all`; they occur within a `where` clause.

A `where` clause is a companion to a pattern; it indicates that Semgrep should match based on the pattern if all the conditions hold.

As an example, take a look at the following example:

```code
all:
  - inside: |
      def $FUNC(...):
        ...
  - |
      eval($X)
where:
  - <condition>
```

Because the `where` clause is on the same indentation level as `all`, Semgrep understands that everything under `where` must be paired with the entire `all` pattern. As such, the results of the ranges matched by the `all` pattern are modified by the `where` pattern, and the output includes some final set of ranges that are matched.

### `metavariable`

Replaces [metavariable-regex](/writing-rules/rule-syntax/#metavariable-regex), [metavariable-pattern](/writing-rules/rule-syntax/#metavariable-pattern), and [metavariable-analysis](/writing-rules/metavariable-analysis/). This operator looks inside the metavariable for a match.

```code
...
where:
  - metavariable: $A
    regex: "(.*)
  - metavariable: $B
    patterns: |
      - "foo($C)"
  - metavariable: $D
    analyzer: entropy
```

### `comparison`

Replaces [focus-metavariable](/writing-rules/rule-syntax/#focus-metavariable). Puts focus on the rode region matched by a single metavariable or a list of metavariables.

```code
...
where:
  - focus: $A
```

## Syntax search mode

New syntax search mode rules must be nested underneath a top-level `match` key. For example:

```code
rules:
  - id: find-bad-stuff
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [python]
    message: |
      Don't put bad stuff!
    match:
      any:
        - |
            eval(input())
        - all:
            - inside: |
                def $FUNC(..., $X, ...):
                  ...
            - |
                eval($X)
```

## Taint mode

The new syntax supports taint mode, and such roles no longer require `mode: taint` in the rule. Instead, everything must be nested under a top-level `taint` key.

The key names for the new syntax taint rules are as follows:

- `pattern-sources` --> sources
- `pattern-sinks` --> sinks
- `pattern-propagators` --> propagators
- `pattern-sanitizers` --> sanitizers
