# Introduction to Semgrep experiments

The experiments category documents experimental features and the way you can use them. In the future, as it is the nature of experiments, some of these experiments can become deprecated, and others can become generally available (GA), meaning that GA features are fully supported parts of Semgrep. If a feature is deprecated, its documentation is moved to the [Deprecated experiments](/writing-rules/experiments/deprecated-experiments/) document. If a feature becomes GA, its docs are moved to a relevant category outside of the experiments section.

Enjoy the experiments, tweak the code, and most importantly share your thoughts! If you see any issues with the experimental features, please [file a bug](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/issues/new/choose).
