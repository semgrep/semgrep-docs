# Data-flow analysis engine overview

Semgrep provides an intra-procedural data-flow analysis engine that provides it with additional capabilities. [Constant propagation](../constant-propagation/) allows Semgrep to, for example, match `return 42` against `return x` when `x` can be reduced to `42` by constant folding. [Taint tracking (aka taint mode)](../taint-mode/) enables you to write simple rules that catch complex [injection bugs](https://owasp.org/www-community/Injection_Flaws), such as those that can result in [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/).

In principle, all data-flow related features are available for any of our [supported languages](/supported-languages/). For further details please check the [data-flow status documentation](../status/).

Make sure that you understand the [design trade-offs](#design-trade-offs) and limitations of the data-flow engine.

At present, Semgrep provides no user-friendly way of specifying your own data-flow analyses, but please [let us know if you have suggestions](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/new/choose). And, if you can code in OCaml, then you are very welcome to [contribute](/docs/contributing/contributing/).

Data-flow analysis is also supported in DeepSemgrep. For more details, see [DeepSemgrep](/docs/deepsemgrep/) documentation.

## Design trade-offs

Semgrep strives for simplicity and to deliver on the promise of lightweight and fast static analysis. In addition to being intra-procedural, here are some other trade-offs:

- No path sensitivity: All _potential_ execution paths are considered, despite that some may not be feasible.
- No pointer or shape analysis: _Aliasing_ that happens in non-trivial ways may not be detected, such as through arrays or pointers. TODO Individual elements in arrays or other data structures are not tracked. There is also no proper field sensitivity at present, but this may be developed in the future.
- No soundness guarantees: Semgrep ignores the effects of `eval`-like functions on the program state. It doesnâ€™t make worst-case sound assumptions, but rather "reasonable" ones.

You can expect both false positives and false negatives. You can remove false positives in different ways, for example, using [pattern-not](../../rule-syntax/#pattern-not) and [pattern-not-inside](../../rule-syntax/#pattern-not-inside). We definitely want to provide you with a way of eliminating false positives, so please [let file an issue if run into some](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/new/choose). We are rather happy to trade false negatives for simplicity and fewer false positives, but you are welcome to open a feature request if Semgrep misses some important bug you would like to catch, and we will certainly consider it.

## Data-flow status

In principle, the data-flow analysis runs on any [language supported by](../../supported-languages.md).

Internally, Semgrep translates the generic syntax tree into an analysis-friendly intermediate language, the _IL_, on which it runs _mostly_ language-agnostic analysis. However, this translation is not fully complete. Unsupported constructs are typically specific to one or a few languages.

Semgrep does not fail even if it finds an unsupported construct. The analysis simply continues while the construct is ignored. This may result in Semgrep not matching some code which should be matched (false negatives) or matching a code which should not be matched (false positives).

Please, report any issue you encounter in our [Semgrep GitHub](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/new/choose).
