  The status of the data-flow analyses.

# Data-flow status

The data-flow based features, including taint tracking, are in beta status.

In principle, the data-flow analyses can run on any of Semgrepâ€™s [supported languages](../../supported-languages.md). Internally, Semgrep translates the generic syntax tree into an analysis-friendly intermediate language, the _IL_, on which it runs _mostly_ language-agnostic analyses. However, this translation is not fully complete. Unsupported constructs are typically specific to one or a few languages.

Semgrep will not fail even if it finds a construct that is not supported. The analysis will simply continue while the construct is ignored. This may cause some false positives or negatives.

Please [report any issues](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/new/choose) you may encounter.
