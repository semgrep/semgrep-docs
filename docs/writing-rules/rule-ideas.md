# Rule prompts

Try answering these questions to uncover important rules for your project.

1. From recent post mortems: what code issues contributed to it?
1. [XYZ] is a (security, performance, other) library that everyone should use, but they don‚Äôt consistently.
1. When you review code, what changes do you frequently ask for?
1. What vulnerability classes from bug bounty submissions reoccur (or appear in different places of the codebase)?
1. Are there eng / perf patterns? Consistent exception handlers?
1. What issues were caused by misconfigurations in Infrastructure-as-Code files (JSON)?
1. What are some ‚Äúinvariants‚Äù that should hold about your code - things that should always or never be true (e.g. every admin route checks if user is admin)?
1. What methods/APIs are deprecated and you‚Äôre trying to move away from?
