# Run a successful proof-of-value (POV) with Semgrep

:::tip Start a POV
For any questions or concerns about starting a proof-of-value (POV), reach out to [<i class="fa-regular fa-envelope"></i>sales@semgrep.com](mailto:sales@semgrep.com).
:::

Run a POV to learn more about Semgrep solutions and receive support that is specific to your infrastructure and business needs. During a POV, you receive dedicated sales, engineering, and support resources to ensure that every Semgrep feature that supports your infrastructure can be implemented quickly and reliably.

## POV requirements

These are some of the requirements the Semgrep team needs from your organization to run a POV.

- The number of trial licenses. How many trial licenses are needed? Who among your organization will be evaluating Semgrep?
-

:::tip Benefits of code access
Code access enables Semgrep to manage your scans without the need for a CI integration. This is the **fastest** and **most scalable** deployment method. Semgrep Managed Scans enables you to onboard repositories for scanning in the least number of clicks.

## General steps 

Running a proof-of-value involves the following steps:

### Both parties agree to running a POV

- From your end (the buyer), a need has been identified and budget has been allocated.
- From Semgrep's end, the team has verified, with your help, that your technical stack is supported by Semgrep. This includes:
    - Programming languages
    - Source code managers
    - Account management
    - And other factors
- **Optional**: At this point, if you'd like a technical deep dive of Semgrep from a sales engineer, you can request for one through your account executive.
- It is recommended that the buyer (you) start gathering and gaining approvals from your organization for resources needed to run the POV, such as repository access. 

### Pre-POV kickoff call

- During the pre-POV kickoff call, both parties set **success criteria**
- You and your organization can define the success criteria, or Semgrep can assist you in creating one. 
- The pre-POV kickoff call ensures that all stakeholders are aligned for the goals of the POV.
- It also ensures that the technical requirements for both parties are clearly communicated.

### Pre-POV preparation

The Semgrep team prepares for the POV with the following tasks:

- Semgrep sets up a **dedicated Slack channel** where you can reach out to the team during the POV.
- Creating an account in Semgrep AppSec Platform for your organization.
- Connecting your source code manager, such as GitHub or Bitbucket, to Semgrep.
- Setting up SSO.
- For on-premise environments, Semgrep sets up the Network Broker to facilitate secure access between Semgrep and your private network.

### Formal POV period

This is a **two-week** period in which Semgrep assists you in deployment, scanning, triage, reporting, and all other related functions for a successful security program. 

### POV conclusion

When the POV ends, Semgrep sets up a wrap-up call to go over the POV. The wrap-up call provides an opportunity for you and your team to give feedback as well.


## Trial license duration

The trial license duration lasts for 30 days.

## Common questions and evaluation criteria

The following sections provide a sample of common questions you and your team may ask to identify specific needs and criteria to evaluate Semgrep:

### General coverage 

- Does the business need a static application security testing (SAST) tool?
- Does the business need a software composition analysis (SCA) tool?
- Does the business need a secrets scanner?
- Does Semgrep support the organization's languages?
- Does Semgrep support the organization's source code manager?
- Does the team need to send scan results to a reporting or application security posture management (ASPM) tool?
- Does Semgrep support the org's bug-tracker or ticketing tool?
    
### Usage

- How easy was it to set up Semgrep to scan the organization's repositories?
