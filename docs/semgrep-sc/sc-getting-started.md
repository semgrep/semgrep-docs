# Getting started with Semgrep Supply Chain

Semgrep Supply Chain detects recently discovered [security vulnerabilities](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/full-listing) in your codebase's open source dependencies, prioritizing findings through [reachability](/semgrep-sc/sc-glossary#reachability) analysis. 

This document walks you through the process of setting up open source dependency scanning with Semgrep Supply Chain.

:::note
Semgrep Supply Chain **supports monorepositories (monorepos)** by treating each subdirectory as its own repository. Findings are grouped under these repositories based on the [lockfile](/semgrep-sc/sc-glossary/#lockfile) or manifest file present in the subdirectory.
:::

## Scanning with Semgrep Supply Chain through Semgrep App

:::tip
This is the preferred method to enable and run Semgrep Supply Chain.
:::

Semgrep Supply Chain scans can be set up from the [Semgrep App](https://semgrep.dev/login) interface.

Perform the following steps to create an account in Semgrep App and add (onboard) a repository for scanning. By adding a repository to Semgrep App, you are able to set up Semgrep Supply Chain scans and receive findings for vulnerabilities which you can triage and remediate.

Read [Step 3](#step-3-enabling-semgrep-supply-chain-scans-from-semgrep-app) if you have already created an account in Semgrep App and added a repository.

### Step 1: Creating an account in Semgrep App

<PlatformSigninIntro />

<Tabs
    defaultValue="signin-github"
    values={[
    {label: 'Sign in with GitHub', value: 'signin-github'},
    {label: 'Sign in with GitLab', value: 'signin-gitlab'},
    ]}
>

<TabItem value='signin-github'>

<PlatformSigninGithub />

See [Permissions in GitHub](/semgrep-app/getting-started-with-semgrep-app/#permissions-for-github) to learn more about how Semgrep features use requested permissions in GitHub.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='signin-gitlab'>

<PlatformSigninGitlab />

See [Permissions in GitLab](/semgrep-app/getting-started-with-semgrep-app/#permissions-for-gitlab) to learn more about how Semgrep features use requested permissions in GitLab.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Step 2: Adding or onboarding a new repository

<PlatformAddRepo />

#### Detecting GitHub repositories

<DetectGhRepos />

### Step 3: Enabling Semgrep Supply Chain scans from Semgrep App

To enable and run a Supply Chain (open source dependency) scan in Semgrep App:

1. Sign in to your Semgrep App account, and then go to **Projects** page.
2. Click **[Projects](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/projects)**, and then click <i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> **gear** icon of the repository on which to run Supply Chain rules.
3. Click <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-large-on"></i> **SSC toggle**. Semgrep Supply Chain rules are included in your next scan, that occurs based on your CI set up, such as schedules and events configuration (push, pull, and merge requests).
4. Optional: Some CI providers enable you to start workflows manually. To start a dependency scan immediately, go to your CI provider's interface and manually begin the Semgrep workflow or job.

When the scan finishes, Semgrep App displays an overview of findings in the **Supply Chain** tab for further triage and remediation. See [Triaging and remediating dependency findings](/semgrep-sc/triaging-and-remediating-vulnerabilities).

#### Events that trigger a Supply Chain dependency scan

Dependency scans can be triggered by the following, depending on your CI set up:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Event</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Scope of scan</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Dependency rule set</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Pull or merge request
   </td>
   <td>diff-aware scan
   </td>
   <td>All dependency rules
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Push or scheduled event, such as a cron job
   </td>
   <td>full scan
   </td>
   <td>All dependency rules
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

For more information on diff-aware and full scans, see [Diff-aware scanning](/docs/semgrep-ci/running-semgrep-ci-with-semgrep-app/#diff-aware-scanning).

#### Blocking a PR or MR

Both reachable and unreachable findings of Semgrep Supply Chain do **not** block a pull request or merge request.

:::info
Semgrep versions v0.122.0 and below previously blocked reachable findings.
:::

### Step 4: Set a daily scan schedule

Semgrep Supply Chain frequently releases new rules. To ensure that your repository is scanned with the latest Semgrep Supply Chain rules, **configure Semgrep Supply Chain to scan your codebase every day**. 

<CiScheduling />

Your Semgrep Supply Chain scan setup is now complete.

## Ignoring dependency findings through `semgrepignore`

See [Ignoring dependency findings](/docs/semgrep-sc/ignoring-lockfiles-dependencies).

## Triaging and remediating dependency findings

Semgrep Supply Chain enables developers to perform triage and remediation through the **[Vulnerabilities](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/supply-chain/vulnerabilities)** page. On this page you can perform the following actions:

* View specific **reachable** vulnerable lines of code in your codebase. This helps to evaluate the threat.
* View specific lines of code where your dependency is being declared.
* Triage a dependency finding.
* Attach a PR or MR, or Jira ticket to the finding.
* Upgrade the dependency that generated the finding to a safe version. A safe version is any newer version of the dependency that does not contain the vulnerability. This resolves the finding.

For more information, see [Triaging and remediating findings](/docs/semgrep-sc/triaging-and-remediating-vulnerabilities).
