# Semgrep Supply Chain supported languages

:::info
This document provides information about supported languages in Semgrep Supply Chain. For supported languages in **Semgrep**, see [Supported Languages](/supported-languages).
:::

<SscIntro/>

Semgrep Supply Chain parses **lockfiles** for dependencies, then scans your codebase for reachable findings based on the lockfiles. Some languages, such as Java, have several lockfiles, depending on your repository's package manager. For some languages, such as Javascript and Python, a manifest file is also parsed.

The following table lists lockfiles, their package manager and language, and their support levels.


## General Availability

<table>
<thead><tr>
    <th>Language</th>
    <th>Supported package managers</th>
    <th>Lockfile</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
   <td>Go</td>
   <td>Go modules (<code>go mod</code>)</td>
   <td><code>go.sum</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td rowspan="2">JavaScript / TypeScript</td>
   <td>npm</td>
   <td><code>package-lock.json</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Yarn</td>
   <td><code>yarn.lock</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td rowspan="2">Python</td>
   <td>pip</td>
   <td><code>Pipfile.lock</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Poetry</td>
   <td><code>poetry.lock</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Ruby</td>
   <td>RubyGems</td>
   <td><code>Gemfile.lock</code></td>
  </tr></tbody>
</table>

## Beta

<table>
  <thead><tr>
   <th>Language</th>
   <th>Supported package managers</th>
   <th>Lockfile</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tbody><tr rowspan="2">
   <td rowspan="2">Java</td>
   <td>Gradle</td>
   <td><code>gradle.lockfile</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Maven (single-file configurations)</td>
   <td><code>pom.xml</code>*</td>
  </tr></tbody>
</table>


_* `pom.xml` is not a lockfile, however Semgrep Supply Chain parses `pom.xml` as the source of truth for dependencies in Maven projects in conjunction with `MANIFEST.mf`._


## Maturity levels

Semgrep Supply Chain has two maturity levels:



* General Availability (GA)
* Beta

Their differences are outlined in the following table:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Feature</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>GA</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Beta</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Rule count
   </td>
   <td>10+
   </td>
   <td>1+
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>r2c rule-writing support
   </td>
   <td>Quickly release new rules for all critical and high vulnerabilities based on the latest <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln">security advisories</a>.
   </td>
   <td>No commitment for new rules based on the latest security advisories.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Semgrep engine language support
   </td>
   <td>Semgrep engine support is GA.
   </td>
   <td>Semgrep engine support is at least Beta.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
