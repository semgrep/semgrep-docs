  In addition to setting up the connection between Semgrep and {props.name}, you
  must assign rules to Comment or Block mode. This customization enables you to:
</span>

- Manage the amount of {props.comment_type} comments your
    developers receive.
- Ensure that only rules that meet your criteria, such as high severity or high confidence rules, and result in findings involving valid secrets produce comments visible to developers, reducing noise.

#### Set rules to Comment or Block mode

The following instructions let you customize what findings or security issues your developers see as comments in their PRs:

1. In Semgrep AppSec Platform, go to **Rules > Policies > Secrets**.
1. Under **Modes <i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i>**, you can see if you have existing rules in either Comment or Block mode. You can also use the filters to find rules you want to set to Comment or Block.
1. Click the **<i class="fa-solid fa-square-check"></i> checkbox** of the rules you want to set. You can use <kbd>Ctrl + Click</kbd> to select rules in bulk.
1. Click **Change modes**.
1. Click either **Block** or **Comment**.

  You have successfully configured {props.comment_type} comments for Semgrep
  Secrets.
</span>

#### Validation state policies

Validation state policies allow you to define how Semgrep handles the following issues:

- **Invalid findings**: the secret has been revoked, was never functional, or used for a custom or private endpoint that Semgrep can't communicate with. For example, a Semgrep rule that tests GitHub credentials may return an invalid finding if Semgrep can't communicate with an on-premise deployment.
- **Validation errors**: Semgrep was unable to reach the secrets provider to test the validity of the credential, or Semgrep received an unexpected response from the API

To edit the policy for invalid secrets and errors:

1. In Semgrep AppSec Platform, go to **Rules > Policies > Secrets**.
1. Click **Validation State Policies**.
1. Choose the mode, either Comment or Block, that you want Semgrep to set for **Invalid findings**.
1. Choose the mode, either Comment or Block, that you want Semgrep to set for **Validation errors**.
