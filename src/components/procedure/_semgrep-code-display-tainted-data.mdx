:::info Prerequisite
Not all Semgrep rules or rulesets make use of dataflow traces, or taint tracking. Ensure that you have a ruleset, such as the **default ruleset** added in your **[Policies page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/policies)**. If this ruleset is not added, go to [https://semgrep.dev/p/default](https://semgrep.dev/p/default), and then click **Add to Policy**. You can add rules that use taint tracking from [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore).

To view the detailed path of tainted data with dataflow traces:

1. Log in to Semgrep AppSec Platform, and click **[Code](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings)** in the **Navigation Bar** to view your findings.
1. Select the finding you're interested in, then do one of the following actions:
   - If the default **Group by Rule** is enabled, click <i class="fa-regular fa-window-restore"></i> **View details** icon on the card of the finding.
   - If **No grouping** view is enabled, click the **header hyperlink** on the card of the finding. In the example screenshot below, the link is titled **tainted-sql-string**.
1. In the section titled **Your code**, you can see the source, traces, and sink of the tainted data. Clicking on a specific line in the trace will highlight it in the context of the file, while clicking on the file name at the top of the right pane will take you directly to that file in your source code manager, such as GitHub or GitLab.
