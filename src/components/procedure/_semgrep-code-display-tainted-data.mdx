:::info Prerequisite
Not all Semgrep rules or rulesets make use of taint tracking. Ensure that you have a ruleset, such as the **default ruleset** added in your **[Rule Board](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/board)**. If this ruleset is not added, go to [https://semgrep.dev/p/default](https://semgrep.dev/p/default), and then click **Add to Rule Board**. You can add rules that use taint tracking from [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore).

To view a detailed path of tainted data with dataflow traces, follow these steps:

1. Log in to Semgrep Cloud Platform, and then click the **[Code](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings)** in the left panel to view your findings.
1. Select a finding where Semgrep Code detected tainted data, and then do one of the following actions:
    - If the default **Group by Rule** is enabled, click <i class="fa-regular fa-window-restore"></i> **View details** icon on the card of the finding.
        ![Click View details if Group by Rule is enabled](/img/cloud-platform-findings-group-by-rule-view-details.png)<br />
    - If **No grouping** view is enabled, click the **header hyperlink** on the card of the finding. In the example on the screenshot below, it is the **tainted-sql-string**.
        ![Click View details if No grouping is enabled](/img/cloud-platform-findings-no-grouping-view-details.png)<br />
1. In the <i class="fa-solid fa-droplet"></i> **Data flow** <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-info"></i> section you can see the source, traces, and sink of the tainted data. The example below displays the path of tainted data across multiple files as Semgrep Pro Engine was enabled.

:::note Get cross-file findings
- Get cross-file findings in your organization. Follow the steps in [Enabling Semgrep Pro Engine](/semgrep-code/semgrep-pro-engine-intro/#enabling-semgrep-pro-engine-in-semgrep-cloud-platform) documentation.
