:::info Prerequisite
Not all Semgrep rules or rulesets make use of dataflow traces, or taint tracking. Ensure that you have a ruleset, such as the **default ruleset** added in your **[Policies page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/policies)**. If this ruleset is not added, go to [https://semgrep.dev/p/default](https://semgrep.dev/p/default), and then click **Add to Policy**. You can add rules that use taint tracking from [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore).

To view the detailed path of tainted data with dataflow traces:

1. Log in to Semgrep AppSec Platform, and click **[Code](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings)** in the left panel to view your findings.
1. Select the finding you're interested in, then do one of the following actions:
   - If the default **Group by Rule** is enabled, click <i class="fa-regular fa-window-restore"></i> **View details** icon on the card of the finding.

   - If **No grouping** view is enabled, click the **header hyperlink** on the card of the finding. In the example on the screenshot below, it is the **tainted-sql-string**.
     ![Click View details if No grouping is enabled](/img/cloud-platform-findings-no-grouping-view-details.png#md-width)
1. In the <i class="fa-solid fa-droplet"></i> **Data flow** <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-info"></i> section, you can see the source, traces, and sink of the tainted data. The example below displays the path of tainted data across multiple files because Semgrep Pro Engine was enabled.
