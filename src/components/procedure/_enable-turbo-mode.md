:::tip Try Turbo mode (beta)
Semgrep can automatically scan for findings on any change in the Rule or Sample Code panes.

Click the <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-large-on"></i> **Turbo mode** toggle to try it out.

In this mode, the **Run** button is hidden because Semgrep scans upon detecting any change to the text. Turbo mode works in both Simple mode and Advanced mode.
