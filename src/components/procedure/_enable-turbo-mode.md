:::tip Try Turbo mode (beta)
Semgrep can automatically scan for findings using the Semgrep OSS Engine, on any change in the Rule or Sample Code panes.

Click the <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-large-on"></i> **Turbo mode** toggle to try it out.

In this mode, the **Run** button is hidden because Semgrep scans upon detecting any change to the text. Turbo mode works in both Simple mode and Advanced mode. Turbo mode cannot be enabled for Semgrep Pro Engine.
