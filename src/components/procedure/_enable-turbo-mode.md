The **Turbo** option runs your rule automatically against Semgrep CE after every keystroke or change to the rule.

Click the <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-large-on"></i> **Turbo mode** toggle to enable.

The **Run** button is hidden in Turbo mode because Semgrep scans after any changes to the rule. Turbo mode works with the editor in either structure or advanced mode.

Turbo mode is unavailable with Semgrep cross-file analysis.
