:::info Prerequisite
- There are **no** prerequisites for users who have logged in to Semgrep Cloud Platform (SCP) for the first time!
- For established users of the Semgrep Cloud Platform: To add a demo project, use a Semgrep Cloud Platform organization **without** any added project.
:::

To add the Semgrep Cloud Platform demo project, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Semgrep Cloud Platform account and switch to an organization that does **not** include any project.
1. On the **[Projects](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/projects)** page, click **Explore a demo project**.
    ![Screenshot of Semgrep Cloud Platform Projects page with Explore a demo project button.](/img/semgrep-app-add-demo-project.png "Screenshot of Semgrep Cloud Platform Projects page with Explore a demo project button.")

The scan automatically begins when you add a repository. Once the scan has finished, you can see the results of a scan in your **[Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/projects)** page. Now you can triage findings and see vulnerabilities that Semgrep Cloud Platform finds in OWASP Juice Shop application.

Review [Viewing and managing findings](/semgrep-app/getting-started-with-semgrep-app/#viewing-and-managing-findings) to find out more about available actions in Semgrep Cloud Platform. See also the [Managing findings in Semgrep Cloud Platform](/semgrep-app/findings/) documentation.

:::note
If you cannot use an SCP organization without any added project, another option is to fork [juice-shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) repository, and then add it to SCP by following the steps described in  [Adding a repository](/semgrep-app/getting-started-with-semgrep-app/#option-b-adding-a-repository-from-github-or-gitlab).
