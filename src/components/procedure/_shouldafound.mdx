This example guides you through steps to report false negatives with Semgrep CLI:

1. See the following example file `file.go`:

    ```go                                    
    package mainâ€‹
    
    import "fmt"
    
    func main() {
        fmt.Println("foo")
    }
    ```

1. In your command-line, run the following command:

    ```sh
    semgrep shouldafound --email "my@email.com" \
    -m "Semgrep missed vulnerable code here" \
    --start 5 --end 7 path/to/my/file.go
    ```

    Specify lines of code to report as false negatives using `--start` and `--end` options. The example above reports all lines between 5 and 7. 

    This sends the following information to semgrep.dev:

    ```sh
    {
        "email": "my@email.com",
        "lines": "func main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"foo\")\n}\n",
        "message": "Semgrep missed vulnerable code here",
        "path": "path/to/my/file.go"
    }
    ```

3. Press <kbd>y</kbd> to send this information to r2c:

    ```sh
    OK to send? [y/N]: y
    ```

    **Note**: Anonymize the data you send to us, as `shouldafound` creates Semgrep Playground links which are public to anyone with access to the URL.

If you send the code, you receive the following notice in your command-line:
