By default, Semgrep comments include both Semgrep Code and Semgrep Supply Chain (SSC) findings information. However, if you would like to disable PR or MR comments for reachable SSC findings, you can do so as follows:

1. Sign in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Go to **Settings > Deployment** and navigate to the **Supply Chain (SCA)** section.
1. Click <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-large-on"></i> **PR/MR comments** to disable commenting.

> Disabling PR/MR comments doesn't disable notifications regarding [license policy violations](/semgrep-supply-chain/license-compliance).
