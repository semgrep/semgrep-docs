:::info Feature maturity
Semgrep's IntelliJ extensions are in **public beta**. Currently, the IntelliJ extension only supports Semgrep Community Edition (CE) - it doesn't support Semgrep Supply Chain, Secrets, Pro rules, or Pro Engine. Please join the [Semgrep community Slack workspace](http://go.semgrep.dev/slack) and let the Semgrep team know if you encounter any issues.
