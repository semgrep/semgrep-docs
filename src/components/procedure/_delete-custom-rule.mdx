To remove a private rule, follow these steps:

1. In the [Semgrep Editor](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/editor), find a private rule to delete under the <i class="fa-solid fa-server"></i> **Library** tab. Private rules are usually stored in the folder with the same name as your Semgrep Cloud Platform organization.
1. Click the rule you want to delete, and then click the <i class="fa-solid fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> three vertical dots.
1. Click <i class="fa-regular fa-trash-can"></i> **Delete**.

Deleting a rule is permanent. If the rule was previously added to the Policies page, it is removed upon deletion.
