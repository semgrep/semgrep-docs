  In addition to setting up the connection between Semgrep and {props.name}, you
  must assign rules to Comment or Block mode. This customization enables you to:

- Manage the <strong>amount of {props.comment_type} comments</strong> your
    developers receive.
- Ensure that only rules that meet your criteria, such as high severity or high confidence rules, produce comments visible to developers, reducing noise.
