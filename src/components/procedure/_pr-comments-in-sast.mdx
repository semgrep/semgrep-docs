  In addition to setting up the connection between Semgrep and {props.name}, you
  must assign rules to Comment or Block mode. This customization enables you to:

- <span>
    Manage the <strong>amount of {props.comment_type} comments</strong> your
    developers receive.
  </span>
- Ensure that only rules that meet your criteria, such as high severity or high confidence rules, produce comments visible to developers, reducing noise.

  Rules in <strong>Block mode</strong> fail the CI job that runs on the{" "}
  {props.comment_type}. Depending on your workflow, this may prevent your{" "}
  {props.comment_type} from merging.
