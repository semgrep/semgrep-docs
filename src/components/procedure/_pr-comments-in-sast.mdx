## Configure comments for Semgrep Code

<span>In addition to setting up the connection between Semgrep and {props.name}, you must assign rules to Comment or Block mode. This customization enables you to:</span>

- <span>Manage the <strong>amount of {props.comment_type} comments</strong> your developers receive.</span>
- Ensure that only rules that meet your criteria, such as high severity or high confidence rules, produce comments visible to developers, reducing noise.

:::tip
<span>Rules in <strong>Block mode</strong> prevent the {props.comment_type} from being merged without triage or remediation.</span>
:::
