1. Next to a finding with status **Open**, click the **Ignore** <i class="fa-regular fa-chevron-down"></i>.
1. Optional: Select a reason of why you are ignoring a finding. Choose either: **False positive**, **Acceptable risk**, **No time to fix**
1. Click **Save**.
1. Optional: Select whether you want to ignore all findings in **Just this file**, **This directory**, or **Parent directory**.
1. Enable the checkbox to: **Remove this rule from Rule board**. This removes the related rule that matched the finding.
