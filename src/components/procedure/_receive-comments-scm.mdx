Receiving PR or MR comments may require additional steps depending on the custom configuration of your VPN or SCM (for example, if you use a static IP without a hostname). Reach out to Semgrep support through the [Semgrep Community Slack](https://go.semgrep.dev/slack) or send an email to [support@semgrep.com](mailto:support@semgrep.com) for any concerns.
