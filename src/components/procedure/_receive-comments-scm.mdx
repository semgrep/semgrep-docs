To enable comments within **self-hosted SCMs** behind firewalls or VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), follow these steps:

1. Add the following IP addresses to your VPN's **ingress** allowlist.
     ```bash
    # These IP addresses are inbound and outbound:
    35.166.231.235
    52.35.248.246
    52.34.137.110
    44.225.64.41
    ```
2. Optional: If you use an **egress allowlist**, add the following IP addresses to the egress allowlist to enable your CI workers to fetch the scan rules, upload findings, and so on.<br />
    ```bash
    # These IP addresses are inbound and outbound:
    35.166.231.235
    52.35.248.246
    52.34.137.110
    44.225.64.41
    ```

3. Test that you are able to receive findings by manually triggering a scan through your CI provider.

:::tip
Receiving PR or MR comments may require additional steps depending on the custom configuration of your VPN or SCM (for example, if you use a static IP without a hostname). Reach out to Semgrep support through the [Semgrep Community Slack](https://go.semgrep.dev/slack) or send an email to [support@semgrep.com](mailto:support@semgrep.com) for any concerns.
