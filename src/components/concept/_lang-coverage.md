Semgrep aims to provide comprehensive and accurate detection of common OWASP Top 10 issues in source code. Semgrep uses **rules**, which are instructions based on which it detects patterns in code. These rules are usually organized in rulesets.

By default, Semgrep Code provides you with the [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> `p/comment`](https://semgrep.dev/p/comment) and [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> `p/default`](https://semgrep.dev/p/default) rulesets. These rulesets provide the most accurate and comprehensive coverage across Semgrep's supported languages.
