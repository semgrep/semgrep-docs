Introduction to what Semgrep is and how it works.

-->

 Semgrep uses **rules**, which encapsulate pattern matching logic and data flow analysis, to scan your code and find issues such as code violations, security issues, and the use of outdated or vulnerable libraries. Semgrep generates and reports to you **findings** whenever it finds code that matches the patterns defined by rules.
