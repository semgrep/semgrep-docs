Introduction to what Semgrep is and how it works.

-->

 Semgrep Code uses **rules**, which encapsulate pattern matching logic and data flow analysis, to scan your code for security issues, style violations, bugs, and more. Semgrep generates and reports **findings** to you whenever it finds code that matches the patterns defined by rules.
