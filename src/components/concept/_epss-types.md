The [Exploit prediction scoring system (EPSS) probability](https://www.first.org/epss/) represents the likelihood that the vulnerability will be exploited in the wild in the next 30 days. Its values range from 0% to 100%. The higher the score, the greater the probability the vulnerability will be exploited. Semgrep groups probabilities as follows:

* <b>High</b>: 50 - 100%
* <b>Medium</b>: 10 - &#60;50%
* <b>Low</b>: &#60;10%
