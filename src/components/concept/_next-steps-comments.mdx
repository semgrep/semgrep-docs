You've set up Semgrep to scan in your repository and send findings after each scan. Your core deployment is almost complete.

Remaining steps include:

- Optional: [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Customize your CI job](/deployment/customize-ci-jobs).
- For software composition analysis (SCA) scans using **Jenkins or Maven**: [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Set up SCA scans for your infrastructure.](/semgrep-supply-chain/setup-infrastructure)
- <span>{props.opening_phrase}</span> <strong>feature branches</strong> (non-trunk branches) when a pull or merge request is open. This is a prerequisite to receiving PR or MR comments. See <a href="/docs/deployment/customize-ci-jobs#set-up-diff-aware-scans">Set up diff-aware scans</a>.
- Set up **PR or MR comments**, which post findings to developers in your SCM. This involves developers in the security process as active participants. See [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> PR or MR comments](/category/pr-or-mr-comments) for next steps.
