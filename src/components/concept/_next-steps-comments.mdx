You've set up Semgrep to scan in your repository and send findings after each scan. Your core deployment is almost complete.

Remaining steps include:

- <span>{props.opening_phrase}</span> <strong>feature branches</strong> (non-trunk branches) when a pull request is open. This is required to set up PR or MR comments. See <a href="/deployment/customize-ci-jobs/#set-up-diff-aware-scans">Set up diff-aware scans</a>.
- Optional: learn about customizing CI jobs: [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Customize your CI job](/deployment/customize-ci-jobs). These customizations can be done any time.
- Set up PR or MR comments, which post findings to developers in your SCM. This involves developers in the security process as active participants. Setting up PR or MR comments also includes feedback tracking on the rules that are most triaged as `Ignored` by developers. See [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> PR or MR comments](/category/pr-or-mr-comments/) for next steps.
