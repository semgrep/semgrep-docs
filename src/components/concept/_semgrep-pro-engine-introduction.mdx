Use Semgrep Code's **cross-file (interfile) analysis** to detect vulnerabilities across files and folders.

By design, Semgrep open-source software (OSS) can only analyze interactions within a single function, also known as **intraprocedural analysis**. This limited scope makes Semgrep OSS fast and easy to integrate into developer workflows.

Semgrep Code runs **cross-function (interprocedural)** analysis by default, and gives security teams the the option to trade off speed for better results and deeper analysis with **cross-file analysis**. By analyzing interactions across files and functions, Semgrep Code can reduce noise, uncover new vulnerabilities, and make results easier to understand.

Semgrep Code is a proprietary extension of Semgrep OSS. Like Semgrep OSS, Semgrep Code runs on source code and doesnâ€™t require compiled code for its analysis.
