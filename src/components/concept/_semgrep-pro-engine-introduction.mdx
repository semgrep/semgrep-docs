Use Semgrep Pro Engine to detect vulnerabilities across files and folders. By design, Semgrep open-source software (OSS) Engine can only analyze interactions within a single function, also known as **intraprocedural analysis**. This limited scope makes Semgrep OSS fast and easy to integrate into developer workflows. Semgrep Pro Engine gives security teams the option to trade off speed for better results and deeper analysis.

Semgrep Pro Engine includes **cross-file (also called interfile analysis)** and **cross-function analysis (also called interprocedural analysis)**, which finds vulnerabilities that aren't detectable with Semgrep OSS. By analyzing interactions across files and functions, Semgrep Pro Engine can reduce noise, uncover new vulnerabilities, and make results easier to understand.

props.extended ? `
Semgrep Pro Engine is a proprietary extension of Semgrep OSS Engine. Just like Semgrep OSS Engine, Semgrep Pro Engine runs on raw source code and it doesn’t require compiled code for its analysis.
