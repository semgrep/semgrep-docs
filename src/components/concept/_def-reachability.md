Reachability refers to whether or not a vulnerable piece of code from a dependency is used in the codebase that imports it. In Semgrep Supply Chain, both a dependency's vulnerable version and code pattern must match for a vulnerability to be considered reachable.

See [Overview of Semgrep Supply Chain](/semgrep-supply-chain/overview) to learn how Semgrep leverages its code-scanning and rule syntax capabilities to provide high-signal rules that determine a finding's reachability. This assists security engineers in remediation and triage processes.
