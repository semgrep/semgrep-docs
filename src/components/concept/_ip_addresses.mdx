If you are behind a firewall, are using a virtual private network (VPN), or have network restrictions regarding access, you may need to add the following IP addresses to the **ingress** allowlist and **egress** allowlist:

```bash
# Ingress IP addresses (from Semgrep to your infrastructure) and egress IP addresses (from your infrastructure to Semgrep)
35.166.231.235
52.35.248.246
52.34.137.110
44.225.64.41
```

#### Additional egress IP addresses

You must also add **CloudFront IP addresses** to your **egress** allowlist. Refer to [<i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i> Locations and IP address ranges of CloudFront edge servers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/LocationsOfEdgeServers.html) for a list of IP addresses.
