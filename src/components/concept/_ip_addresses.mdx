If you are behind a firewall, are using a virtual private network (VPN), or have network restrictions regarding access, you may need to add the following IP addresses to the **ingress** allowlist and **egress** allowlist:

```bash
# These IP addresses are inbound and outbound:
35.166.231.235
52.35.248.246
52.34.137.110
44.225.64.41
```

The following features make use of these IP addresses:

- [PR and MR comments](/category/pr-or-mr-comments)
- [Semgrep Managed Scans](/deployment/managed-scanning)
- [Semgrep Assistant](/semgrep-assistant/getting-started)
