Semgrep Supply Chain is a software composition analysis (SCA) tool that detects security vulnerabilities in your codebase introduced by open source dependencies. It can also:

* Generate a software bill of materials (SBOM) that provides a complete inventory of your open source components
* Query for information about your dependencies
* Support the enforcement of your business' open source package licensing requirements
* Detect malicious dependencies (currently in private beta; reach out to [support](/support) to join the program)
