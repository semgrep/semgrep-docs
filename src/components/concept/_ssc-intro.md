Semgrep Supply Chain is a software composition analysis (SCA) tool that detects security vulnerabilities in your codebase introduced by open source dependencies. It can also generate a software bill of materials (SBOM) that provides a complete inventory of your open source components, query for information about your dependencies, and supports the enforcement of your business' open source package licensing requirements.
