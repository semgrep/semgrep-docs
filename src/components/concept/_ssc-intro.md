Detect recently discovered [security vulnerabilities](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/full-listing) in your codebase's open-source dependencies using Semgrep Supply Chain. Leverage Semgrep's code-scanning capabilities to run high-signal rules that determine a vulnerability's [reachability](/docs/semgrep-sc/sc-glossary/#reachability). Semgrep Supply Chain evaluates dependencies based on their version and use in your codebase.
