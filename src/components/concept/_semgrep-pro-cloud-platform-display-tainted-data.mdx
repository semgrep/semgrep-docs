Semgrep Cloud Platform can display findings that show interfile analysis capabilities of Semgrep Pro Engine by displaying data flow of tainted data. To display such findings, follow the required steps in [Enabling Semgrep Pro Engine](/deepsemgrep/deepsemgrep-introduction/#enabling-semgrep-pro-engine-in-semgrep-cloud-platform) documentation.

Findings that display tainted data can help you to track the sources, traces, and sinks of the taint as it propagates through different files in the code. For general information about taint analysis, see [Taint tracking](/writing-rules/data-flow/taint-mode/) documentation.
