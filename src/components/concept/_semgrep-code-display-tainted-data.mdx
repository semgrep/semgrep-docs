Semgrep Code can provide you with a visualization of the path of untrusted (**tainted**) data in specific findings. Findings that display tainted data can help you to track the sources and sinks of the tainted data as they propagate through a body of a function or a method. For general information about taint analysis, see [Taint tracking](/writing-rules/data-flow/taint-mode/) documentation.

With Semgrep Pro Engine, Semgrep Code can display findings that show the propagation of tainted data across multiple files. To get such findings, follow the required steps in [Enabling Semgrep Pro Engine](/semgrep-code/semgrep-pro-engine-intro/#enabling-semgrep-pro-engine-in-semgrep-cloud-platform) documentation.

This feature is also called dataflow traces, and an underlying CLI command is `--dataflow-traces`.

You can view dataflow traces in:
- The [Findings page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) of Semgrep Code. For more details, see [Path of tainted data in Semgrep Code](/semgrep-code/semgrep-pro-engine-data-flow/).
- The PR or MR comments created by Semgrep Code running in your CI. To enable this feature, see the following documentation:
    - To see dataflow traces in GitHub PR comments, see [Dataflow traces in PR comments](/semgrep-cloud-platform/github-pr-comments/#viewing-the-path-of-tainted-data-in-pr-comments) section.
    - To see dataflow traces in GitLab MR comments, see [Dataflow traces in MR comments](/semgrep-cloud-platform/gitlab-mr-comments/#viewing-the-path-of-tainted-data-in-mr-comments) section.
