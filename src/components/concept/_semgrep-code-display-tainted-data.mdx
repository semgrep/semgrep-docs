With **dataflow traces**, Semgrep Code can provide you with a visualization of
the path of tainted, or untrusted, data in specific findings. This path can help
you track the sources and sinks of the tainted data as they propagate through
the body of a function or a method. For general information about taint
analysis, see [Taint tracking](/writing-rules/data-flow/taint-mode).

When running Semgrep Code from the command line, you can pass in the flag
`--dataflow-traces` to use this feature.

You can view dataflow traces in:

- Semgrep AppSec Platform by going to Semgrep Code's [Findings page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open). For more details, see [Path of tainted data in Semgrep
  Code](/semgrep-code/semgrep-pro-engine-data-flow).
- The PR or MR comments created by Semgrep Code running in your CI/CD system. To enable
  this feature, see:
  - _GitHub users_: [Dataflow traces in PR
    comments](/semgrep-appsec-platform/github-pr-comments/#view-the-path-of-tainted-data-in-pr-comments)
  - _GitLab users_: [Dataflow traces in MR
    comments](/semgrep-appsec-platform/gitlab-mr-comments/#view-the-path-of-tainted-data-in-mr-comments)
