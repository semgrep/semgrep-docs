## Notification and alert de-duplication

Notifications are sent only the first time a given finding is detected.

When running a diff-aware scan, Semgrep doesn't notify you when a pull request has a finding that existed on the base branch already,
even if that line is moved or re-indented.

Semgrep also tracks notifications that have already been sent, so subsequent scans of the same changes in a pull request won't result in duplicate notifications.
