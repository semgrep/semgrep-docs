To configure comments for Supply Chain, you must define a Supply Chain policy. This policy lets you set the specific conditions, such as transitivity and reachability, that trigger a comment. These conditions are unique to Supply Chain findings.

See the [Policies documentation](/semgrep-supply-chain/policies) for more information.
