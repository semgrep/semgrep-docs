Quickly view all the findings your organization has fixed in a previous time period, such as a quarter or half-year, by using this filter.
:::

The time period filter allows you to see which vulnerabilities were opened, fixed, or triaged at a certain period of time. The time period filter is **not** additive; it is a filter operation that precedes other filters in the page. For example, if you select **Last triaged** and select the status **Status Open** filter, no findings appear because by definition, there are no triaged findings that are also open.

The following filters are available:

- Triage state:
  - Last opened
  - Last triaged
  - Last fixed
- Time period:
  - Last 1 day
  - Last 7 days
  - Last 1 month
  - Last 3 months
  - Last 6 months
  - Last 1 year
  - All time
