The time period filters allow you to see which vulnerabilities were opened, fixed, or triaged during a certain period of time. The time period filter is **not** additive; it is a filter operation that precedes other filters on the page. For example, if you select **Last triaged** and select the status **Status Open** filter, no findings appear because, by definition, there are no triaged findings that are also open.

The following filters are available:

- Triage state update action:
  - Opened in
  - Triaged in
  - Fixed in
- Time period:
  - Last day
  - Last 7 days
  - Last 30 days
  - Last 3 months
  - Last 6 months
  - Last year
  - All time
