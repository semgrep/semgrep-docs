Directly report code which Semgrep did **not** match as you expected with the `shouldafound` option. The `shouldafound` enables you to report false negatives (vulnerabilities which were not detected) without leaving your command-line interface (CLI).

Shouldafound is useful in contexts such as:

- A bug report uncovers an SQL injection vulnerability that needs to be caught by Semgrep.
- You found issues manually during a code review, but you want Semgrep to find these issues automatically next time.
- A security consultant reviews customer code and adds anonymized versions of their finding so Semgrep can help them find that issue automatically in the future.
