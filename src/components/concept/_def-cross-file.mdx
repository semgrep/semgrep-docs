Cross-file analysis (also known as **interfile analysis**) takes into account how information flows between files. In particular, cross-file analysis includes **cross-file taint analysis**, which tracks unsanitized variables flowing from a source to a sink through arbitrarily many files. Other analyses performed across files include constant propagation and type inference.

Cross-file analysis is usually used in contrast to intrafile, or per-file analysis, where each file is analyzed as a standalone block of code.
