Semgrep Cloud Platform can display the path of untrusted (**tainted**) data in specific findings. Findings that display tainted data can help you to track the sources and sinks of the tainted data as they propagate through a body of a function or a method. For general information about taint analysis, see [Taint tracking](/writing-rules/data-flow/taint-mode/) documentation.

With Semgrep Pro Engine, Semgrep Cloud Platform can display findings that show the propagation of tainted data across multiple files. To get such findings, follow the required steps in [Enabling Semgrep Pro Engine](/semgrep-code/semgrep-pro-engine-intro/#enabling-semgrep-pro-engine-in-semgrep-cloud-platform) documentation.
