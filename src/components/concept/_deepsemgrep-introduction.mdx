Improve your scan results for entire codebases with interfile coding paradigms using DeepSemgrep instead of Semgrep's regular intrafile (within-a-single-file) approach. DeepSemgrep empowers you to easily scan whole repositories that have object-oriented programming paradigms with classes in different files to find vulnerabilities in your code. DeepSemgrep is a proprietary extension of free and open source Semgrep which leverages global analysis tools, and uses the same rules as Semgrep.
