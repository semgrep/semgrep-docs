<dt>Reachability analysis</dt>
<dd>
Reachability refers to whether or not a vulnerable code pattern from a dependency is used in the codebase that imports it. In Semgrep Supply Chain, both a dependency's vulnerable version and code pattern must match for a vulnerability to be considered reachable.
</dd>
<dt>License detection</dt>
<dd>
Semgrep Supply Chain's **license compliance** feature enables you to explicitly allow or disallow (block) a package's use in your repository based on its license. For example, your company policy may disallow the use of packages with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC-BY-NC) license. Semgrep can help enforce this restriction.
</dd>
<dt>Malicious dependency detection</dt>
<dd>
Semgrep is able to detect malicious dependencies in your projects and in pull requests (PRs) or merge requests (MRs).
</dd>
<dt>SBOM generation</dt>
<dd>
Semgrep enables you to generate a software bill of materials (SBOM) to assess your third-party dependencies and comply with auditing procedures. Semgrep Supply Chain (SSC) can generate an SBOM for each repository you have added to Semgrep AppSec Platform.
