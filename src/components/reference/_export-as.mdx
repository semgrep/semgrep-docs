Navigate to the root of your codebase, and run your first scan. The specific command you use depends on how you want to view the results.

To run a scan using recommended rules for your programming language, and view the results in the CLI:

```console
semgrep scan
```

To export the results to a plain text file:

```console
semgrep scan --text --text-output=semgrep.txt
```

To export the results to a SARIF file:

```console
semgrep scan --sarif --sarif-output=semgrep.sarif
```

To export the results to a JSON file:

```console
semgrep scan --json --json-output=semgrep.json
```

To view your results in multiple formats, combine the appropriate flags:

```console
# obtain results as text output and as JSON, SARIF
semgrep scan --text --text-output=semgrep.txt --json --json-output=semgrep.json --sarif --sarif-output=semgrep.sarif
```
