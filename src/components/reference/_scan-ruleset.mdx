You can scan your project using `--config auto` to automatically obtain rules tailored to your project:

```console
semgrep scan --config auto --pro
```

:::info
Semgrep collects pseudonymous metrics when you use rules from the Registry. You can turn this off with `--metrics=off`.
:::

To scan your project with a specific ruleset, either one that you write or one that you obtain from the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore), use the `--config` flag.

```console
# Scan with the rules defined in rules.yaml
semgrep scan --config rules.yaml
```

You can include as many configuration flags as necessary.

```console
# Scan with rules defined in two separate config files
semgrep scan --config rules.yaml --config more_rules.yaml
```

Rules stored under a **hidden directory**, such as `dir/.hidden/myrule.yml`, are processed by Semgrep when scanning with the `--config` flag.

Scan with rules in a **directory** and **all** its subdirectories:

```console
semgrep scan --config DIRECTORY_NAME
```

Scan with all YAML rules detected in the **current working directory** and all its **subdirectories**:
```console
semgrep scan --config .
```
