| Status | Description |
| -----------  | ------------ |
| **Open** | Findings are open by default. A finding is open if it was present in the code last time the code was scanned with semgrep and it has not been ignored. An open finding represents a match between the code and a rule that is enabled in the repository. Open findings require action, such as rewriting the code to eliminate the detected vulnerability. |
| **Ignored** | Findings that are ignored are present in the code, but have been labeled as unimportant. Ignored findings may be labeled that way because they are false positives or because they have been deprioritized. You can mark findings as ignored through Semgrep App (see [Managing finding status](/semgrep-app/findings/#managing-finding-status-bulk-triage)) or by adding a code comment (see [nosemgrep comments](ignoring-files-folders-code/#reference-summary)). |
| **Fixed** | <p>Fixed findings were detected in a previous scan, but are no longer detected in the most recent scan of that same branch. The Semgrep rule that matched the finding and the filepath where the finding was located must both still be present for the finding to be marked as fixed. </p> <p> Change the state of a finding to **fixed** by: <ol type="a"><li>Fixing the code so the rule does not match it.</li><li>Editing the Semgrep rule so it no longer matches the code.</li></ol></p> |

Findings can also be **removed**. A removed finding does not count towards a fix rate or the total number of findings, and does not appear in the app. A finding is considered removed if it is not found in the most recent scan of the branch where it was detected due to any of the following conditions:

* The rule isn't enabled on the repository anymore 
* The file path where the finding appeared is no longer found (it was deleted, renamed, added to a `.semgrepignore`, added to a `.gitignore` or added to the list of ignored paths in Semgrep App)
* The PR or MR where the finding was detected has been closed without merging
