| Status | Description |
| -----------  | ------------ |
| **Open** | Findings are open by default. A finding is open if it was present the last time Semgrep scanned the code and it has not been ignored. An open finding represents a match between the code and a rule that is enabled in the repository. Open findings require action, such as rewriting the code to eliminate the detected vulnerability. |
| **Ignored** | Findings that are ignored are present in the code, but have been labeled as unimportant. Ignore findings that are false positives or deprioritized issues. Mark findings as [ignored through Semgrep Cloud Platform](/semgrep-code/findings/#managing-finding-status) or by adding a [nosemgrep code comment](/ignoring-files-folders-code/#reference-summary). |
| **Fixed** | <p>Fixed findings were detected in a previous scan, but are no longer detected in the most recent scan of that same branch. </p> <p> To change the state of a finding to **fixed**: <ol type="a"><li>Fix the code so the rule does not match it.</li><li>Edit the Semgrep rule so it no longer matches the code.</li></ol></p> |

:::info Findings triaged across refs
Findings triaged (ignored, reopened) in a specific branch, PR, or MR are also triaged in all other branches, PRs, and MRs of a specific repository. In addition, if you filter for any other [Git references](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References) (refs) on the [Findings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open) page, and then triage a finding, it is also automatically triaged in all other branches, PRs, MRs, and refs.
:::

Findings can also be **removed**. A removed finding does not count towards the fix rate or the number of findings. The removed finding also does not appear in the Semgrep Cloud Platform. A finding is removed if it is not found in the most recent scan of the branch where it was detected due to any of the following conditions:

* The rule isn't enabled on the repository anymore.
* The file path where the finding appeared is no longer found (it was deleted, renamed, added to a `.semgrepignore`, added to a `.gitignore` or added to the list of ignored paths in Semgrep Cloud Platform).
* For GitHub organization accounts: the PR or MR where the finding was detected has been closed without merging.
