| Triage state | Description |
| -----------  | ------------ |
| **Open** | Findings are open by default. An open finding is currently present in the code and represents a match between the code and a rule that is enabled in the repository. Open findings require action, such as rewriting the code for vulnerabilities or refactoring the code. |
| **Ignored** | Findings that are ignored are present in the code, but are labeled as code that Semgrep can ignore. Ignore findings that are false positives or deprioritized issues. You can mark findings as ignored through Semgrep App (see [Managing triage states](/semgrep-app/findings/#managing-triage-states-bulk-triage)). |
| **Fixed** | <p>Fixed findings were detected in a previous scan of a particular branch, but no longer trigger a match in the most recent scan of that same branch. The Semgrep rule that matched the finding and the code that triggered the match (and created a finding) must both be present for the finding to be marked as fixed. </p> <p> Change the triage status of a finding to **fixed** by: <ol type="a"><li>Fixing the code so the rule cannot match it.</li><li>Editing the Semgrep rule so it no longer matches the code.</li></ol></p> |
