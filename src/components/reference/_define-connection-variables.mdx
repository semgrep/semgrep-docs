### Define environment variables needed to connect Semgrep to other CI providers

<span>For CI providers aside from {props.name}, additional environment variables must be set:</span>

<br />
<br />

- <span><code><a href="/semgrep-ci/ci-environment-variables/#semgrep_pr_id">SEMGREP_PR_ID</a></code> is set to the {props.comment_type}  number of the pull request on {props.name}.</span>
- [`SEMGREP_REPO_NAME`](/semgrep-ci/ci-environment-variables/#semgrep_repo_name) is set to the repository name.
- [`SEMGREP_REPO_URL`](/semgrep-ci/ci-environment-variables/#semgrep_repo_url) is set to the repository URL where your project is viewable online.

These values do not have to be fixed or hardcoded. They can be variables passed to the job. For more information, see [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i> Sample CI configurations](/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs).
