Semgrep Cloud Platform's Policies page displays all rules and rulesets that are used to scan repositories. These rules are scanned based on the repository's programming language and framework as well as additional Semgrep parameters, such as ignored files.

For example, given five repositories each with different programming languages, Semgrep only scans using rules and rulesets for that repository's language that are in the Policies page.

Semgrep's speed is not affected by having multiple rules for different languages in the Policies page.

You may select rules and rulesets from your own rules, your organization's rules, or rules from the Registry.

The Policies page uses **rule modes** to determine what actions to undertake when a finding is generated by the rule. Users are able to select the following rule modes:

<dl>
    <dt>Monitor</dt>
    <dd>Rules set to Monitor mode show findings only on Semgrep Cloud Platform, without notifying developers.</dd>
    <dt>Comment</dt>
    <dd>Rules set to Comment mode show findings to developers through PR or MR comments.</dd>
    <dt>Block</dt>
    <dd>Rules set to Block mode prevent merges and commits, in addition to showing findings in Semgrep Cloud Platform and PRs or MRs.</dd>
</dl>    

To add rules and rulesets to your Policies page:

1. Click **Policies** on the left sidebar.
2. Click **Add Rules**. You are taken to Semgrep Registry.
3. Enter a search term in the Registry search bar or browse to find rulesets and rules.
4. When you have found a rule to add, click on the rule's card.
5. Click **Add to Policy**.
6. Select what rule mode to set the rule to.
