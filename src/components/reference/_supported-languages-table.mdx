- **Experimental**: experimental support with many known bugs.
    - Looking for dedicated users to help us improve these languages.
    - Expect limited support responses, as these languages will be lowest priority.
    - Semgrep Playground and Semgrep Editor support may be limited for these languages. 
- **Beta**: supported language with known bugs.
    - Looking for beta users to report bugs and rapidly iterate with our team.
    - Expect best-effort support responses when there are no higher priority requests being handled.
- **GA**: production-level support with few known bugs.
    - Looking for bug reports and feedback from users.
    - Expect timely and thorough support responses, generally within 24 hours.
