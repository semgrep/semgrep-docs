NAME
       semgrep ci - the recommended way to run semgrep in CI

SYNOPSIS
       semgrep ci [OPTION]â€¦

DESCRIPTION
       In pull_request/merge_request (PR/MR) contexts, `semgrep ci` will only
       report findings that were introduced by the PR/MR.

       When logged in, `semgrep ci` runs rules configured on Semgrep App and
       sends findings to your findings dashboard.

       Only displays findings that were marked as blocking.

OPTIONS
       -a, --autofix
           Apply autofix patches. WARNING: data loss can occur with this
           flag. Make sure your files are stored in a version control system.
           Note that this mode is experimental and not guaranteed to function
           properly. 

       --allow-local-builds
           Experimental: allow building projects contained in the repository.
           This allows Semgrep to identify dependencies and dependency
           relationships when lockfiles are not present or are insufficient.
           However, building code may inherently require the execution of
           code contained in the scanned project or in its dependencies,
           which is a security risk.

       --allow-untrusted-validators
           Allows running rules with validators from origins other than
           semgrep.dev. Avoid running rules from origins you don't trust.

       --audit-on=VAL (absent SEMGREP_AUDIT_ON env)

       --baseline-commit=VAL (absent SEMGREP_BASELINE_COMMIT env)
           Only show results that are not found in this commit hash. Aborts
           run if not currently in a git directory, there are unstaged
           changes, or given baseline hash doesn't exist. 

       --code
           Run Semgrep Code (SAST) product.

       -d, --dump-command-for-core
           <internal, do not use>

       --dataflow-traces
           Explain how non-local values reach the location of a finding (only
           affects text and SARIF output).

       --debug
           All of --verbose, but with additional debugging information.

       --develop
           Living on the edge.

       --diff-depth=VAL (absent=2)
           The depth of the Pro (interfile) differential scan, the number of
           steps (both in the caller and callee sides) from the targets in
           the call graph tracked by the deep preprocessor. Only applied in
           differential scan mode. Default to 2. 

       --disable-nosem
           negates --enable-nosem

       --disable-version-check
           negates --enable-version-check

       --dry-run
           When set, will not start a scan on semgrep.dev and will not report
           findings. Instead will print out json objects it would have sent.

       --dryrun
           If --dryrun, does not write autofixes to a file. This will print
           the changes to the console. This lets you see the changes before
           you commit to them. Only works with the --autofix flag. Otherwise
           does nothing. 

       --emacs
           Output results in Emacs single-line format.

       --emacs-output=VAL
           Write a copy of the emacs output to a file or post to URL.

       --enable-nosem
           Enables 'nosem'. Findings will not be reported on lines containing
           a 'nosem' comment at the end. Enabled by default.

       --enable-version-check (absent SEMGREP_ENABLE_VERSION_CHECK env)
           Checks Semgrep servers to see if the latest version is run;
           disabling this may reduce exit time after returning results. 

       --exclude=PATTERN
           Skip any file or directory whose path that matches PATTERN.
           '--exclude=*.py' will ignore the following: 'foo.py',
           'src/foo.py', 'foo.py/bar.sh'. '--exclude=tests' will ignore
           'tests/foo.py' as well as 'a/b/tests/c/foo.py'. Multiple
           '--exclude' options may be specified. PATTERN is a glob-style
           pattern that uses the same syntax as gitignore and semgrepignore,
           which is documented at
           https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format 

       --exclude-minified-files
           Skip minified files. These are files that are > 7% whitespace, or
           who have a large number of bytes per line. By default minified
           files are scanned 

       --exclude-rule=VAL
           Skip any rule with the given id. Can add multiple times.

       --experimental
           Enable experimental features.

       -f VAL, -c VAL, --config=VAL
           Not supported in 'ci' mode

       --fake-backend=VAL
           Internal flag.

       --files-with-matches
           Output only the names of files containing matches. REQUIRES
           --experimental

       --force-color (absent SEMGREP_FORCE_COLOR env)
           Always include ANSI color in the output, even if not writing to a
           TTY; defaults to using the TTY status 

       --gitlab-sast
           Output results in GitLab SAST format.

       --gitlab-sast-output=VAL
           Write a copy of the GitLab SAST output to a file or post to URL.

       --gitlab-secrets
           Output results in GitLab Secrets format.

       --gitlab-secrets-output=VAL
           Write a copy of the GitLab Secrets output to a file or post to
           URL.

       --historical-secrets
           Scans git history using Secrets rules.

       --include=PATTERN
           Specify files or directories that should be scanned by semgrep,
           excluding other files. This filter is applied after these other
           filters: '--exclude' options, any filtering done by git (or other
           SCM), and filtering by '.semgrepignore' files. Multiple
           '--include' options can be specified. A file path is selected if
           it matches at least one of the include patterns. PATTERN is a
           glob-style pattern such as 'foo.*' that must match the path. For
           example, specifying the language with '-l javascript' might
           preselect files 'src/foo.jsx' and 'lib/bar.js'. Specifying one of
           '--include=src', '--include=*.jsx', or '--include=src/foo.*' will
           restrict the selection to the single file 'src/foo.jsx'. A choice
           of multiple '--include' patterns can be specified. For example,
           '--include=foo.* --include=bar.*' will select both 'src/foo.jsx'
           and 'lib/bar.js'. Glob-style patterns follow the syntax supported
           by gitignore and semgrepignore, which is documented at
           https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format 

       --incremental-output
           Output results incrementally. REQUIRES --experimental

       --interfile-timeout=VAL (absent=0)
           Maximum time to spend on interfile analysis. If set to 0 will not
           have time limit. Defaults to 0 s for all CLI scans. For CI scans,
           it defaults to 3 hours.

       --internal-ci-scan-results
           Internal flag.

       -j VAL, --jobs=VAL (absent=4)
           Number of subprocesses to use to run checks in parallel. Defaults
           to the number of cores detected on the system (1 if using --pro). 

       --json
           Output results in Semgrep's JSON format.

       --json-output=VAL
           Write a copy of the json output to a file or post to URL.

       --junit-xml
           Output results in JUnit XML format.

       --junit-xml-output=VAL
           Write a copy of the JUnit XML output to a file or post to URL.

       --legacy
           Prefer old (legacy) behavior.

       --log-backend=VAL
           Internal flag.

       --matching-explanations
           Add debugging information in the JSON output to trace how
           different parts of a rule are matched (a.k.a., "Inspect Rule" in
           the Semgrep playground)

       --max-chars-per-line=VAL (absent=160)
           Maximum number of characters to show per line.

       --max-lines-per-finding=VAL (absent=10)
           Maximum number of lines of code that will be shown for each match
           before trimming (set to 0 for unlimited).

       --max-log-list-entries=VAL (absent=100)
           Maximum number of entries that will be shown in the log (e.g.,
           list of rule ids, list of skipped files). A zero or negative value
           disables this filter. Defaults to 100

       --max-memory=VAL (absent=0)
           Maximum system memory in MiB to use during the interfile
           pre-processing phase, or when running a rule on a single file. If
           set to 0, will not have memory limit. Defaults to 0. For CI scans
           that use the Pro Engine, defaults to 5000 MiB. 

       --max-target-bytes=VAL (absent=1000000)
           Maximum size for a file to be scanned by Semgrep, e.g '1.5MB'. Any
           input program larger than this will be ignored. A zero or negative
           value disables this filter. Defaults to 1000000 bytes

       --metrics=VAL (absent=auto or SEMGREP_SEND_METRICS env)
           Configures how usage metrics are sent to the Semgrep server. If
           'auto', metrics are sent whenever the --config value pulls from
           the Semgrep server. If 'on', metrics are always sent. If 'off',
           metrics are disabled altogether and not sent. If absent, the
           SEMGREP_SEND_METRICS environment variable value will be used. If
           no environment variable, defaults to 'auto'. 

       --no-autofix
           negates -a/--autofix

       --no-dryrun
           negates --dryrun

       --no-exclude-minified-files
           negates --exclude-minified-files

       --no-force-color
           negates --force-color

       --no-git-ignore
           negates --use-git-ignore

       --no-rewrite-rule-ids
           negates --rewrite-rule-ids

       --no-secrets-validation
           Disables secret validation.

       --no-semgrepignore-v2
           negates --semgrepignore-v2

       --no-suppress-errors
           negates --suppress-errors

       --no-trace
           negates --trace

       -o VAL, --output=VAL
           Save search results to a file or post to URL. Default is to print
           to stdout.

       --optimizations=VAL (absent=all)
           Turn on/off optimizations. Default = 'all'. Use 'none' to turn all
           optimizations off. 

       --oss-only
           Run using only the OSS engine, even if the Semgrep Pro toggle is
           on. This may still run Pro rules, but only using the OSS features. 

       --pro
           Inter-file analysis and Pro languages (currently Apex, C#, and
           Elixir. Requires Semgrep Pro Engine. See
           https://semgrep.dev/products/pro-engine/ for more.

       --pro-intrafile
           Intra-file inter-procedural taint analysis. Implies
           --pro-languages. Requires Semgrep Pro Engine. See
           https://semgrep.dev/products/pro-engine/ for more.

       --pro-languages
           Enable Pro languages (currently Apex, C#, and Elixir). Requires
           Semgrep Pro Engine. See https://semgrep.dev/products/pro-engine/
           for more.

       --pro-path-sensitive
           Path sensitivity. Implies --pro-intrafile. Requires Semgrep Pro
           Engine. See https://semgrep.dev/products/pro-engine/ for more.

       --profile
           <undocumented>

       -q, --quiet
           Only output findings.

       --rewrite-rule-ids
           Rewrite rule ids when they appear in nested sub-directories (Rule
           'foo' in test/rules.yaml will be renamed 'test.foo'). 

       --sarif
           Output results in SARIF format.

       --sarif-output=VAL
           Write a copy of the SARIF output to a file or post to URL.

       --scan-unknown-extensions
           If true, target files specified directly on the command line will
           bypass normal language detection. They will be analyzed according
           to the value of --lang if applicable, or otherwise with the
           analyzers/languages specified in the Semgrep rule(s) regardless of
           file extension or file type. This setting doesn't apply to target
           files discovered by scanning folders. Defaults to false. 

       --secrets
           Run Semgrep Secrets product, including support for secret
           validation. Requires access to Secrets, contact
           support@semgrep.com for more information.

       --semgrepignore-v2
           '--semgrepignore-v2' forces the use of the newer Semgrepignore v2
           implementation for discovering and filtering target files.
           Conversely, '--no-semgrepignore-v2' is the deprecated option that
           forces the use of the legacy Semgrepignore v1.
           '--semgrepignore-v2' is the default for Semgrep Community Edition,
           and for now '--no-semgrepignore-v2' is still the default when
           using the '--pro*' options. 

       --skip-unknown-extensions
           negates --scan-unknown-extensions

       --subdir=VAL
           Scan only a subdirectory of this folder. This creates a project
           specific to the subdirectory unless SEMGREP_REPO_DISPLAY_NAME is
           set. Expects a relative path. (Note that when two scans have the
           same SEMGREP_REPO_DISPLAY_NAME but different targeted directories,
           the results of the second scan overwrite the first.)

       --supply-chain
           Run Semgrep Supply Chain product.

       --suppress-errors (absent SEMGREP_SUPPRESS_ERRORS env)
           Configures how the CI command reacts when an error occurs. If
           true, encountered errors are suppressed and the exit code is zero
           (success). If false, encountered errors are not suppressed and the
           exit code is non-zero (failure).

       --text
           Output results in text format.

       --text-output=VAL
           Write a copy of the text output to a file or post to URL.

       --timeout=VAL (absent=5.)
           Maximum time to spend running a rule on a single file in seconds.
           If set to 0 will not have time limit. Defaults to 5.0 s. 

       --timeout-threshold=VAL (absent=3)
           Maximum number of rules that can time out on a file before the
           file is skipped. If set to 0 will not have limit. Defaults to 3. 

       --trace
           Record traces from Semgrep scans to help debugging. This feature
           is meant for internal use and may be changed or removed without
           warning. 

       --trace-endpoint=VAL (absent SEMGREP_OTEL_ENDPOINT env)
           Endpoint to send OpenTelemetry traces to, if `--trace` is present.
           The value may be `semgrep-prod` (default), `semgrep-dev`,
           `semgrep-local`, or any valid URL. This feature is meant for
           internal use and may be changed or removed without warning. 

       --use-git-ignore
           '--use-git-ignore' is Semgrep's default behavior. Under the
           default behavior, Git-tracked files are not excluded by Gitignore
           rules and only untracked files are excluded by Gitignore rules.
           '--no-git-ignore' causes semgrep to not call 'git' and not consult
           '.gitignore' files to determine which files semgrep should scan.
           As a result of '--no-git-ignore', gitignored files and Git
           submodules will be scanned unless excluded by other means
           ('.semgrepignore', '--exclude', etc.). This flag has no effect if
           the scanning root is not in a Git repository.

       -v, --verbose
           Show more details about what rules are running, which files failed
           to parse, etc. 

       --vim
           Output results in vim single-line format.

       --vim-output=VAL
           Write a copy of the vim output to a file or post to URL.

       --x-dump-rule-partitions=VAL (absent=0)
           Internal flag.

       --x-dump-rule-partitions-dir=VAL
           Internal flag.

       --x-dump-rule-partitions-strategy=VAL
           Internal flag.

       --x-eio
           [INTERNAL] Rely on an EIO based implementation for the -j flag

       --x-ignore-semgrepignore-files
           [INTERNAL] Ignore all '.semgrepignore' files found in the project
           tree for the purpose of selecting target files to be scanned by
           semgrep. Other filters may still apply. THIS OPTION IS NOT PART OF
           THE SEMGREP API AND MAY CHANGE OR DISAPPEAR WITHOUT NOTICE. 

       --x-merge-partial-results-dir=VAL
           Internal flag.

       --x-merge-partial-results-output=VAL
           Internal flag.

       --x-partial-config=VAL
           Internal flag.

       --x-partial-output=VAL
           Internal flag.

       --x-pro-naming
           <internal, do not use>

       --x-tr
           <internal, do not use>

       --x-upload-partial-results=VAL
           Internal flag.

       --x-upload-partial-results-scan-id=VAL
           Internal flag.

       --x-validate-partial-results-actual=VAL
           Internal flag.

       --x-validate-partial-results-expected=VAL
           Internal flag.

COMMON OPTIONS
       --help[=FMT] (default=auto)
           Show this help in format FMT. The value FMT must be one of auto,
           pager, groff or plain. With auto, the format is pager or plain
           whenever the TERM env var is dumb or undefined.
