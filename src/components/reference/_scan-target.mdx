## Scan target

A scan target is any file, or collection of files and directories that Semgrep can scan. While Semgrep can scan **any** text file through `generic` mode, Semgrep primarily scans the following:

### Codebase

Any code files within a specified directory and its subdirectories.

### Project

A repository or codebase that you have added to Semgrep Cloud Platform for scanning along with finding metadata and other Semgrep data and resources.

### Repository

A location, typically remote, for source code, including metadata relating to the source code. Semgrep supports Git repositories.
