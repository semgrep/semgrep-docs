### Semgrep Supply Chain rule update frequency

Semgrep ingests CVE information and security advisories from sources such as [Reviewed GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed) to ensure effective rule coverage. Semgrep processes new information at least once per day to:

* Generate rules for new security advisories;
* Update rules based on changes to existing security advisories.
