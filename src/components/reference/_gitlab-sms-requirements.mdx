Semgrep Managed Scanning (SMS) requires one of the following plans:

- GitLab Premium
- GitLab Ultimate
- GitLab Self Managed

You must provide a GitLab group access token or personal access token to Semgrep. The token must have the `api` scope assigned to it.

During SMS onboarding, the group or user to which the token is assigned must have one of the following roles: 

- `Maintainer`
- `Owner`
- `Admin`

This is because managed scans of GitLab repositories require the enablement of webhooks to facilitate diff-aware scans and the creation of pull request comments by Semgrep. The webhooks are enabled by default when you set up Managed Scans and add GitLab as a source code manager. Once onboarding is complete, you can downgrade the role assigned to the token to `Developer`.
