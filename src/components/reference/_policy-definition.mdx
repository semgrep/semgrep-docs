A policy defines the set of rules that Semgrep runs and the workflow actions it undertakes when a rule from the policy generates a finding. The workflow action performed by Semgrep when it detects a finding can include notifying Slack channels or posting a comment in the pull request or merge request that generated the finding.

Not to be confused with **policy-as-code**.
